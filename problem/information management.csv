Others but relevant to IM,"IT professional identity: needs, perceptions, and belonging","Brooks, Nita G. and Riemenschneider, Cindy K. and Hardgrave, Bill C. and O'Leary-Kelly, Anne M.","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS","20","1","87-102","2011","JAN","Identification;Workforce;It Profession;Distinctiveness Of Profession","","A theoretical model of professional identification is developed and empirically examined as a means to understanding information technology (IT) workers' attachment to the IT profession. Professional identification represents oneness with or belonging to a profession and provides a unique means of investigating and evaluating the IT profession. Results from a survey of 305 IT workers indicate that professional identification is directly impacted by three factors: (1) the individual's need for professional identification; (2) the individual's perceived similarity to others in the IT profession; and (3) the individual's perceptions of the IT profession, signifying the importance of internalization to identification. Professional identification is also indirectly impacted by the public's perception of the IT profession.

,"Reflections and opinions on 25 years with the ISJ","Avison, David and Fitzgerald, Guy","INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL","22","3","179-193","2012","MAY","Information Systems Journal;Journal Editors;Journal Editing;Information Systems Discipline;Information Systems History","","Reflecting on 25 years as editors of the Information Systems Journal(ISJ), we analyse some statistics on the ISJ over this period. These include the origins of papers published in terms of author gender, geographical region and academic department, the type of research in terms of positivist or interpretive (and empirical, critical and descriptive, if the latter) and qualitative, quantitative, mixed or descriptive, research method and research category. The paper also consists of personal reflections on the ISJ discussing issues such as motivation for journal editing, impact of research on practice (and vice versa) and loss of control as the journal develops. We also use the ISJ lens to reflect on the discipline of IS as a whole. We hope therefore that this paper might also form part of a collection on the history of the IS discipline."
,"The Framing Effects of Multipart Pricing on Consumer Purchasing Behavior of Customized Information Good Bundles","Goh, Kim Huat and Bockstedt, Jesse C.","INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH","24","2","334-351","2013","JUN","Behavioral Economics;Behavioral Experiments;Bundling;Customization;Consumer Behavior;Econometrics;Information Goods;Multipart Pricing;Natural Experiments","","Applying behavioral economic theories, we hypothesize that consumers have sticky reference prices for individual information goods, but their perceived value for customizable bundle offers can be significantly influenced by the framing of a multipart pricing scheme. The potential impacts of these framing effects are measurable changes in consumer behavior and sales outcomes. We conducted a series of behavioral experiments and a large-scale natural field experiment involving actual purchases of customized information good bundles to confirm and analyze the hypothesized effects. The results demonstrate a consumer's willingness to purchase a customized bundle of information goods, the size of the resulting bundling, and the consumer's perceptions of the transaction are each significantly influenced by the design of the multipart pricing scheme. These results hold even when the final price and size of a customized bundle are the same across differing schemes. We discuss the potential tradeoffs in economic outcomes that result from price framing (e.g., likelihood of sale versus size of purchased bundles) and the implications for information good retailers."
,"Performance-Based Advertising: Advertising as Signals of Product Quality","Feng, Juan and Xie, Jinhong","INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH","23","3, 2","1030-1041","2012","SEP","Performance-Based Pricing;Advertising;Signaling;Sponsored Search;Quality","","Performance-based advertising is becoming increasingly popular in the online advertising industry, where advertisers pay the publisher only when the advertisement generates an action (e.g., a click-through or a purchase). This paper illustrates that adopting this emerging advertising scheme has profound impacts on one fundamental function of advertising-signaling product quality. We identify several important dimensions that affect the signaling function of performance-based advertising relative to its traditional counterpart (impression-based advertising). These include: (1) information-total advertising expenditure is determined after the demand is realized, so it is unobservable to consumers when making purchase decisions; (2) ad performance-the measured performance (e.g., recorded click-throughs) includes actions generated by first-time buyers (i.e., advertising performance) and actions generated by repeat buyers (i.e., product performance), which increases the cost of signaling through advertising; (3) demand uncertainty-the merchant pays only when a response to the advertisement is generated, which reduces the merchant's advertising uncertainty. We build a model of performance-based advertising by explicitly incorporating these factors, and we derive the conditions under which switching to performance-based advertising will (a) disable or strengthen the signaling function of advertising, (b) help or hurt the merchant, and (c) lead to a higher or lower advertising expenditure."
,"Punishment, Justice, and Compliance in Mandatory IT Settings","Xue, Yajiong and Liang, Huigang and Wu, Liansheng","INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH","22","2","400-414","2011","JUN","Punishment;Punishment Expectancy;Distributive Justice;Procedural Justice;Informational Justice;Fairness;Mandatory Context;Compliance","","This paper aims to understand the influence of punishment and perceived justice on user compliance with mandatory information technology (IT) policies. Drawing on punishment research and justice theory, a research model is developed. Data collected from a field survey of enterprise resource planning (ERP) users are analyzed to test the proposed hypotheses. The results indicate that IT compliance intention is strongly influenced by perceived justice of punishment, which is negatively influenced by actual punishment. When perceived justice of punishment is considered, the effect of satisfaction on compliance intention decreases and that of perceived usefulness becomes insignificant. This paper contributes to information systems (IS) research and practice by drawing attention to the importance of punishment, particularly perceived justice of punishment, in mandatory IT settings. It delineates the relationships among actual punishment, punishment expectancy, perceived justice of punishment, and IT compliance intention, and thus provides a better understanding of user compliance behavior in mandatory IT settings."
,"Reducing Buyers' Uncertainty About Taste-Related Product Attributes","Markopoulos, Panos M. and Clemons, Eric K.","JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS","30","2","269-299","2013","FAL","Consumer Uncertainty Reduction;Information Dissemination;Product Ratings;Product Review Variance","","It is becoming increasingly important for firms to know when to take steps to reduce buyers' uncertainty about products and services. This paper focuses on investments that firms can make to reduce buyers' uncertainty about taste-related product attributes. Using an analytical model, we show that firms should disclose more taste-related information when the customer segment they directly target represents a larger share of the overall market. We further show that there are practical ways by which managers can decide if such disclosure investments are financially beneficial to their firms. Specifically, we show that the variance of consumer reviews can guide such decisions. The paper's main contribution to the extant literature is to show that firms must consider the variance, but not the mean, of buyer reviews, to determine the need to invest in reducing consumer uncertainty about taste-related attributes. The papers's findings are managerially important due to the ubiquity of consumer reviews. They are novel because most of the previous literature views the mean of the review as the key indicator. Finally, they are general in their applicability since they are independent of any assumptions about heuristics that buyers may use to ascertain product quality from the reviews of previous buyers."
,"COMPETING FOR ATTENTION: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF ONLINE REVIEWERS' STRATEGIC BEHAVIOR","Shen, Wenqi and Hu, Yu Jeffrey and Ulmer, Jackie Rees","MIS QUARTERLY","39","3","683-696","2015","SEP","Online Attention;Scarcity Of Attention;Competing For Attention;Online Product Reviews;User-Generated Content","","Top online reviewers who reliably gain consumers' attention stand to make significant financial gains and monetize the amount of attention and reputation they have earned. This study explores how online reviewers strategically choose the right product to review and the right rating to post so that they can gain attention and enhance reputation. Using book reviews from Amazon and Barnes & Noble (BN), we find that reviewers on Amazon, where a reviewer ranking system quantifies reviewers' online reputations, are sensitive to the competition among existing reviews and thus tend to avoid crowded review segments. However, on BN, which does not include such a ranking mechanism, reviewers do not respond to the competition effect. In addition, reviewers on Amazon post more differentiated ratings compared with reviewers on BN since the competition for attention on Amazon is more intense than on BN. Overall, reviewers on Amazon behave more strategically than reviewers on BN. This study yields important managerial implications for companies to improve their design of online review systems and enhance their understanding of reviewers' strategic behaviors."
,"EVALUATING JOURNAL QUALITY AND THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS SENIOR SCHOLARS' JOURNAL BASKET VIA BIBLIOMETRIC MEASURES: DO EXPERT JOURNAL ASSESSMENTS ADD VALUE?","Lowry, Paul Benjamin and Moody, Gregory D. and Gaskin, James and Galletta, Dennis F. and Humpherys, Sean L. and Barlow, Jordan B. and Wilson, David W.","MIS QUARTERLY","37","4","993+","2013","DEC","Information Systems Journal Rankings;Scientometrics;Bibliometrics;Journal Quality;Sens-6;Sens-8;Self-Citation;Impact Factor;H-Index;Social Network Analysis;Expert Opinion;Composite Ranking Or Rating;Ais Senior Scholars Basket Of Journals;Nomologies For Dissemination Of Scientific Knowledge","","Information systems journal rankings and ratings help scholars focus their publishing efforts and are widely used surrogates for judging the quality of research. Over the years, numerous approaches have been used to rank IS journals, approaches such as citation metrics, school lists, acceptance rates, and expert assessments. However, the results of these approaches often conflict due to a host of validity concerns. In the current scientometric study, we make significant strides toward correcting for these limitations in the ranking of mainstream IS journals. We compare expert rankings to bibliometric measures such as the ISI Impact Factor T, the h-index, and social network analysis metrics. Among other findings, we conclude that bibliometric measures provide very similar results to expert-based methods in determining a tiered structure of IS journals, thereby suggesting that bibliometrics can be a complete, less expensive, and more efficient substitute for expert assessment. We also find strong support for seven of the eight journals in the Association for Information Systems Senior Scholars' basket of journals. A cluster analysis of our results indicates a two-tiered separation in the quality of the highest quality IS journals-with MIS Quarterly, Information Systems Research, and Journal of Management Information Systems belonging, in that order, to the highest A+ tier. Journal quality metrics fit nicely into the sociology of science literature and can be useful in models that attempt to explain how knowledge disseminates through scientific communities."
,"HOW SHOULD TECHNOLOGY-MEDIATED ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE BE EXPLAINED? A COMPARISON OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CRITICAL REALISM AND ACTIVITY THEORY","Allen, David K. and Brown, Andrew and Karanasios, Stan and Norman, Alistair","MIS QUARTERLY","37","3","835-854","2013","SEP","Critical Realism;Activity Theory;Theory;Information Systems;Organization Change;Evaluation","","In this paper, critical realism and activity theory are compared within the context of theorizing technology-mediated organizational change. An activity theoretic analysis of the implementation of large-scale disruptive information systems in a public sector setting (in particular concerning paramedic treatment of heart attack patients and ambulance dispatch work activity) is used to illustrate how activity theory makes a significant contribution to critical realism, by (1) locating technology within activity systems and theorizing change through contradictions and congruencies within those systems; (2) developing recent critical realism-inspired theorization of the inscription of cultural and social relations within technology; and (3) developing recent insights of critical realist researchers regarding the way in which the performance management agenda is mediated through IS."
,"BIDDING BEHAVIOR EVOLUTION IN SEQUENTIAL AUCTIONS: CHARACTERIZATION AND ANALYSIS","Goes, Paulo B. and Karuga, Gilbert G. and Tripathi, Arvind K.","MIS QUARTERLY","36","4","1021-1042","2012","DEC","Sequential Online Auctions;Bidding Behavior;Bidding Strategies;Auction Design","","Retailers are increasingly exploiting sequential online auctions as an effective and low cost distribution channel for disposing large quantities of inventory. In such auction environments, bidders have the opportunity of participating in many auctions to learn and choose the bidding strategy that best fits their preferences. Previous studies have mostly focused on identifying bidding strategies in single, isolated online auctions. Using a large data set collected from sequential online auctions, we first characterize bidding strategies in this interesting online environment and then develop an empirical model to explain bidders' adoption of different strategies. We also examine how bidders change their strategies over time. Our findings challenge the general belief that bidders employ their strategies regardless of experience or their specific demand. We. find that bidders' demand, participation experience, and auction design parameters affect their choice of bidding strategies. Bidders with unit demand are likely to choose early bidding strategies, while those with multiple unit demand adopt late bidding strategies. Auction design parameters that affect bidders' perception of demand and supply trends affect bidders' choice of bidding strategies. As bidders gain experience within a sequence of auctions, they start choosing late bidding strategies. Our findings help auctioneers to design auction sequences that maximize their objectives."
,"IS EMPLOYEE ATTITUDES AND PERCEPTIONS AT VARYING LEVELS OF SOFTWARE PROCESS MATURITY","Ply, Janet K. and Moore, Jo Ellen and Williams, Clay K. and Thatcher, Jason Bennett","MIS QUARTERLY","36","2","601-624","2012","JUN","Software Process Improvement;Cmm;Job Satisfaction;Role Conflict;Role Ambiguity;Work Overload;Cynicism;Professional Efficacy;Control Theory;Is Professionals","","Taking a control theory view of software process innovation, we tested prevalent beliefs regarding software process maturity and Information Systems employee attitudes and perceptions by surveying 736 IS professionals in 10 organizations at varying levels of the CMM (capability maturity model). Although anecdotal reports and the scant empirical studies to date suggest job attitudes and perceptions are more positive for employees in organizations at higher levels of software process maturity, we found evidence of a more complex picture. While our data supported expectations that role conflict and perceived work overload were lower for IS professionals in organizations at a level of maturity where software process behavioral controls are implemented, other results were not fully in line with prevalent beliefs. Most notably, IS workers reported significantly lower professional efficacy and lower job satisfaction in organizations at CMM Level 3, where behavioral controls are the dominant form of formal control, than in organizations at Level I, which is relatively free of formal controls. Some anticipated positive attitudes and perceptions surfaced in organizations at the highest rungs of software process maturity (CMM Levels 4/5), where the established behavioral controls are supplemented by substantial outcome controls, as IS professionals reported lower role ambiguity and higher job satisfaction than did their counterparts in organizations at CMM Level 3."
,"CIO REPORTING STRUCTURE, STRATEGIC POSITIONING, AND FIRM PERFORMANCE","Banker, Rajiv D. and Hu, Nan and Pavlou, Paul A. and Luftman, Jerry","MIS QUARTERLY","35","2","487-504","2011","JUN","Chief Information Officer (Cio);Cio Reporting Structure;Strategic Positioning;Porter'S Generic Strategies;Product/Service Differentiation;Cost Leadership;Firm Performance;Abnormal Stock Returns;Cash Flows From Operations;Chief Executive Officer (Ceo);Chief Financial Officer (Cfo)","","Almost 30 years after the introduction of the CIO position, the ideal CIO reporting structure (whether the CIO should report to the CEO or the CFO) is yet to be identified There is an intuitive assumption among some proponents of IT that the CIO should always report to the CEO to promote the importance of IT and the CIO's clout in the firm, while some adversaries of IT call for a CIO CFO reporting structure to keep a tab on IT spending. However, we challenge these two ad hoc prescriptions by arguing that neither CIO reporting structure is necessarily optimal, and that the CIO reporting structure should not be used to gauge the strategic role of IT in the firm. First, extending the strategy structure paradigm, we propose that a firm's strategic positioning (differentiation or cost leadership) should be a primary determinant of its CIO reporting structure. We hypothesize that differentiators are more likely to have their CIO report to the CEO in order to pursue IT initiatives that help the firm's differentiation strategy. We also hypothesize that cost leaders are more likely to have their CIO report to the CFO to lead IT initiatives to facilitate the firm's cost leadership strategy. Second, extending the alignment fit view, we propose that firms that align their CIO reporting structure with their strategic positioning (specifically, differentiation with a CIO CEO reporting structure and cost leadership with a CIO CFO reporting structure) will have superior future performance. Longitudinal data from two periods (1990-1993 and 2006) support the proposed hypotheses, validating the relationship between a firm's strategic positioning and its CIO reporting structure, and also the positive impact of their alignment on firm performance. These results challenge the ad hoc prescriptions about the CIO reporting structure, demonstrating that a CIO CEO reporting structure is only superior for differentiators and a CIO CFO reporting structure is superior only for cost leaders. The CIO reporting structure must, therefore, be designed to align with the firm's strategic positioning, independent of whether IT plays a key strategic role in the firm."
,"THE EFFECTS OF TREE-VIEW BASED PRESENTATION ADAPTATION ON MOBILE WEB BROWSING","Adipat, Boonlit and Zhang, Dongsong and Zhou, Lina","MIS QUARTERLY","35","1","99-121","2011","MAR","Presentation Adaptation;Mobile Handheld Device;Web Browsing And Searching;Interface Design;Usability Testing","","Accessing the Web from mobile handheld devices has become increasingly common. However, accomplishing that task remains challenging mainly due to the physical constraints of handheld devices and the static presentation of Web pages. Adapting the presentation of Web pages is, therefore, critical to enabling effective mobile Web browsing and information searching. Based on cognitive fit theory and information foraging theory, we propose a novel hybrid approach to adapting Web page presentation that integrates three types of adaptation techniques, namely tree-view, hierarchical text summarization, and colored keyword highlighting. By following the design science research framework, we implemented the proposed approach on handheld devices and empirically evaluated the effects of presentation adaptation on mobile Web browsing. The results show that presentation adaptation significantly improves user performance and perception of mobile Web browsing. We also discover that the positive impact of presentation adaptation is moderated by the complexity of an information search task. The findings have significant theoretical and practical implications for the design and implementation of mobile Web applications."
