Others but relevant to Transportation,"Ranking the substantive problems in the Dutch Cost-Benefit Analysis practice","Mouter, Niek and Annema, Jan Anne and van Wee, Bert","TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE","49","","241-255","2013","MAR","Cost-Benefit Analysis;Substantive Problems;Perceptions Of Key Participants;Content Analysis;Transport Project Appraisal","","This paper investigates the perceptions of key participants in the Dutch Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) practice regarding substantive problems when appraising spatial-infrastructure projects with CBA. Two research methods were applied. Firstly, 86 key participants in the Dutch CBA practice were interviewed in-depth in order to obtain an overview and a ranking of perceived substantive problems with CBA in the Netherlands. Secondly, the people interviewed were also asked to fill in a written questionnaire in which they were asked to rank the substantive problems once again, in order to improve the validity of the ranking; 74 of the participants completed this questionnaire. The most important conclusions of this paper are, firstly, that key participants in the Dutch CBA practice consider 'problems with the estimation of the non-monetized project effects' as the most important substantive problem cluster and 'problems with monetizing project effects' as the second most important substantive problem cluster. Secondly, key participants in the Dutch CBA practice consider the 'problem analysis' in a CBA to be a very important substantive problem. Thirdly, there is, in a broad sense, consensus among the different groups in the Dutch CM practice concerning their perception of the seriousness of problem clusters and the way they rank the problem clusters. Fourthly, a large part of the substantive problems mentioned by the key participants in the Dutch CBA practice are non-specific CBA problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
,"The relationships between e-shopping and store shopping in the shopping process of search goods","Cao, Xinyu (Jason)","TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE","46","7","993-1002","2012","AUG","Activity Fragmentation;E-Commerce;Ict;Marketing;Multi-Channel Shopping;Transportation","","Internet facilitates hybrid shopping processes by enabling consumers to acquire information, experience product, and conduct transaction using different media (e.g., Internet, store, and catalog) at different locations at different times. Although several studies have explored how internet transactions and store sales influence each other, few investigated transportation implications of the hybrid shopping process of single products. Using 540 internet users in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, USA, this study decomposed their shopping processes of a group of search goods (books, CDs, VCDs, videotapes, and album) to understand the relationships of e-shopping and store shopping. We found the media for product awareness, information search, and product trial are important predictors of transaction medium; and the awareness medium is the most important. Further, 17% of store buyers used internet for information search and/or product trial, and about 10% of internet buyers made trips to store to acquire information and/or experience product. The findings carry implications for marketing strategies and travel demand analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
,"The joint estimation of respondent-reported certainty and acceptability with choice","Rose, John M. and Beck, Matthew J. and Hensher, David A.","TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE","71","","141-152","2015","JAN","Certainty Calibration;Vehicle Choice;Joint Estimation;Heterogeneity;Choice Certainty;Alternative Acceptability","","In the stated choice literature, increasing attention has been paid to methods that seek to close the gap between the choices from these experiments and the choices experienced in the real world. Attempts to produce model estimates that are truer to real market behaviours are especially important for transportation, where many important policy decisions rely on such experiments. A recent approach that has emerged makes use of a certainty index whereby respondents report how certain they are about each choice they make. Additional literature also posits that when making decisions, people first identify an acceptable set of alternatives (alternative acceptability) such that a consideration set if formed and it is from this reduced set that the ultimate choice is made. This paper presents two models that jointly estimates choice and choice certainty and choice and alternative acceptability. This joint estimation allows the modeller to overcome potential endogeneity that may exist between these responses. In comparing choices of differing certainty, surprisingly little difference in marginal sensitivities are found. This is not the case in the alternative acceptability models however. An important finding of this research is that what could be interpreted as preference heterogeneity may in fact be more closely linked to scale. The ramifications of these results on future research are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
,"A multivariate hurdle count data model with an endogenous multiple discrete-continuous selection system","Bhat, Chandra R. and Astroza, Sebastian and Sidharthan, Raghuprasad and Bhat, Prerna C.","TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL","63","","77-97","2014","MAY","Multivariate Count Data;Generalized Ordered-Response;Multiple Discrete-Continuous Models;Hurdle Model System;Endogeneity","","This paper proposes a new econometric formulation and an associated estimation method for multivariate count data that are themselves observed conditional on a participation selection system that takes a multiple discrete-continuous model structure. This leads to a joint model system of a multivariate count and a multiple discrete-continuous selection system in a hurdle-type model. The model is applied to analyze the participation and time investment of households in out-of-home activities by activity purpose, along with the frequency of participation in each selected activity. The results suggest that the number of episodes of activities as well as the time investment in those activities may be more of a lifestyle- and lifecycle-driven choice than one related to the availability of opportunities for activity participation.

,"Quality control of weigh-in-motion data incorporating threshold values and rational procedures","Mai, Derong and Turochy, Rod E. and Timm, David H.","TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES","36","","116-124","2013","NOV","Weigh-In-Motion System;Wim Data;Quality Control;Threshold Check;Rational Check","","Weigh-in-motion (WIM) stations constitute a key source of traffic data for use in mechanistic-empirical pavement design. One of the major improvements provided by the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) is in traffic characterization. Instead of converting all truck axles to 18,000 lb equivalent single axles (ESALs), the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) simulates every truck axle, and the associated stresses and strains imposed on the pavement structure, from a wide range of axle load spectra (ALS). This paper presents an objective approach to quality control (QC) of WIM data that includes threshold checks that detect implausible values of individual variables in the truck weight records and rational checks that examine patterns in axle load distributions and relationships among the variables. Instead of using subjective visual comparisons of gross vehicle weight (GVW) distributions, this research implements a peak-range check, peak-shift check, and correlation analysis to quantify the ALS comparison process of rational checks. A number-of-axles check that calculates the average number of axles per vehicle class is also introduced herein. The entire QC procedure has been applied to three years of data from 12 WIM stations in Alabama that used bending plate sensors. As a result, 23.8% of data were filtered out, and all data from one WIM station were removed. Therefore, QC of WIM data is strongly recommended, regardless of the extent of WIM system calibration. Furthermore, it is also recommended that the rational checks module be integrated in the data collection process for rapid detection of systematic errors."
,"Match bus stops to a digital road network by the shortest path model","Li, Jing-Quan","TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES","22","","119-131","2012","JUN","Map Matching Algorithms;Digital Road Network;Bus Stop Matching;Shortest Path Model","","We investigate the bus stop matching problem that determines the associated road link of a bus stop whose latitude and longitude are available. The bus stop matching problem is challenging due to (1) the approximate representation of road maps; (2) the inaccurate location data of road maps and stops; (3) the complicated road geometry; and (4) the lack of dynamic vehicle information, such as vehicle trajectory, speed, turning, and heading. In order to exploit relational information between bus stops, we first organize the bus stops by route and list the stops in the order they appear in a given bus route. We then develop a network model that utilizes such relational information and transforms the stop matching problem into a shortest path problem. We also develop certain approaches to examine the potential mismatches by the proposed shortest path model. Case studies show that the average success rate of our approach is more than 98%. Our approach also performs robustly under a regular perturbation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
,"Co-location decision tree for enhancing decision-making of pavement maintenance and rehabilitation","Zhou, Guoqing and Wang, Linbing","TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES","21","1","287-305","2012","APR","Decision Tree;Decision-Making;Pavement Maintenance And Rehabilitation;Gis;Visualization","","This paper presents a new decision tree induction method, called co-location-based decision tree (CL-DT), to enhance the decision-making of pavement maintenance and rehabilitation strategies. The proposed algorithm utilizes the co-location characteristics of spatial attribute data in the pavement database. The paper first presented the co-location mining algorithm, including spatial attribute data selection, determination of rough candidate co-locations, determination of candidate co-locations, pruning the non-prevalent co-locations, and induction of co-location rules, and then focused on the development of the co-location decision tree (CL-DT) algorithm, which includes the non-spatial attribute data selection, co-location algorithm modeling, node merging criteria, and co-location decision tree induction. A pavement database covering four counties, which are provided by North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT), is used to verify the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrated that (1) the proposed CL-DT algorithm can make a better decision, and has higher accuracy than the existing decision tree methods do; (2) the training data can be fully played roles in contribution to decision tree induction and the computational time taken for the tree growing, tree drawing and rule generation is largely decreased; (3) quantity and locations of six treatment strategies proposed by the ITRC and by CL-DT is much close for each treatment strategy.

,"Evaluating the effects of bus design on passenger flow: Is agent-based simulation a feasible approach?","Rexfelt, O. and Schelenz, T. and Karlsson, M. and Suescun, A.","TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES","38","","16-27","2014","JAN","Public Transportation;Bus Development;Simulation;Dwell Time;Passenger Flow;Boarding;Alighting","","In this paper, we propose an agent-based simulation approach that is capable of simulating the flow of passengers on board buses and at bus stops. The intention is that it will be applied during vehicle development to analyze how vehicle design affects passenger flow, and thus also how it affects system performance such as dwell time. In turn, this could aid the developers in making design decisions early in the development process. Besides introducing the simulation tool itself, the paper explores the realism of the data generated by the tool. A number of passenger flow experiments featuring a full-scale bus mockup and 50 participants were carried out. The setup of these experiments mirrored a number of 'bus journeys' (regarding vehicle design, number of passengers boarding/alighting at each stop and so on) that had previously been simulated using the simulation tool. When the data from the simulations were compared with the data from the passenger flow experiments, it could be concluded that the tool is indeed able to generate realistic passenger flows, although with some errors when a large number of passengers board/alight. The simulated dwell times were rationally affected by the tested bus layout aspects. It was concluded that the tool makes it possible to evaluate how variations in bus layouts affect passenger flow, providing data of sufficiently high quality to be useful in early phases of vehicle design.

,"Tradable credit schemes for managing bottleneck congestion and modal split with heterogeneous users","Tian, Li-Jun and Yang, Hai and Huang, Hai-Jun","TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW","54","","1-13","2013","AUG","Bottleneck Model;Tradable Credit Scheme;Mode Choice;User Heterogeneity","","This paper examines the efficiency of a tradable travel credit scheme for managing bottleneck congestion and modal split in a competitive highway/transit network with continuous heterogeneity in the individuals' value of time. Each user is initially endowed with a certain amount of travel credits and can sell or buy additional credits in a free trading market. Time-dependent credit charge is implemented only for usage of the road bottleneck. We show that both the modal split and credit charge at equilibrium are unique, and the scheme is always Pareto-improving when the system optimum is achieved. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

,"Integrated Airline Crew Pairing and Crew Assignment by Dynamic Constraint Aggregation","Saddoune, Mohammed and Desaulniers, Guy and Elhallaoui, Issmail and Soumis, Francois","TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE","46","1","39-55","2012","FEB","Airline Crew Scheduling;Integrated Crew Pairing And Crew Assignment;Column Generation;Dynamic Constraint Aggregation","","Traditionally, the airline crew scheduling problem has been decomposed into a crew pairing problem and a 1 crew assignment problem, both of which are solved sequentially. The first consists of generating a set of least-cost crew pairings (sequences of flights starting and ending at the same crew base) that cover all flights. The second aims at finding monthly schedules (sequences of pairings) for crew members that cover all pairings previously built. Pairing and schedule construction must respect all safety and collective agreement rules. In this paper, we focus on the pilot crew scheduling problem in a bidline context where anonymous schedules must be built for pilots and high fixed costs are considered to minimize the number of scheduled pilots. We propose a model that completely integrates the crew pairing and crew assignment problems, and we develop a combined column generation/dynamic constraint aggregation method for solving them. Computational results on real-life data show that integrating crew pairing and crew assignment can yield significant savings-on average, 3.37% on the total cost and 5.54% on the number of schedules for the 7 tested instances. The integrated approach, however, requires much higher computational times than the sequential approach."

First discrepancies of fundamental diagrams of well-known planning handbooks for pedestrian facilities and evacuation routes are discussed. To proof the correspondence to experimental data, published measurements available in literature are collected and compared. In the second part we derive a fundamental diagram for stairs downwards based on precise trajectories. In addition we scrutinize the influence of the slope of stair on the fundamental diagram. To check whether our experiments performed under laboratory conditions are comparable with characteristics of motion of every day situations, we present a comparison with a field study carried out at the same external staircase. Furthermore the contribution shows a method to gain topographical information of density, velocity, and specific flow structures to get a microscopic insight into pedestrian dynamics on stairs. This information could be used to identify effective bottlenecks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
