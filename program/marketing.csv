The Journal of Consumer Research Reaches a Milestone","Rapp, Justine M. and Hill, Ronald Paul",JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH,42,1,19-29,2015,JUN,Consumer Research;Historical Review;Methodological Issues,,"The Journal of Consumer Research has completed four decades as one of the top journals in the larger field of marketing as well as the premier outlet for research on consumer behavior. This elite status is based, in part, on its stated objective as a multidisciplinary journal that allows for a variety of topics, methods, and populations that are central to collectives of scholars from many social sciences and methodological orientations. While a few articles have reviewed the level of diversity within the journal and among its peers, none to date has taken an expansive look at what is studied, how it is examined, and which consumers are used to determine the validity of our theoretical contributions. Thus this article looks across the life span of JCR to address these issues and finds considerable progress along with major areas that should be addressed by the community of researchers that constitutes our field.","When, Why, and How Controversy Causes Conversation","Chen, Zoey and Berger, Jonah",JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH,40,3,580-593,2013,OCT,,,"How does controversy affect conversation? Five studies using both field and laboratory data address this question. Contrary to popular belief, controversial things are not necessarily more likely to be discussed. Controversy increases likelihood of discussion at low levels, but beyond a moderate level of controversy, additional controversy actually decreases likelihood of discussion. The controversy-conversation relationship is driven by two countervailing processes. Controversy increases interest (which increases likelihood of discussion) but simultaneously increases discomfort (which decreases likelihood of discussion). Contextual factors such as anonymity and whether people are talking to friends or strangers moderate the controversy-conversation relationship by impacting these component processes. Our framework sheds light on how, when, and why controversy affects whether or not things are discussed.",Optimal Admission and Scholarship Decisions: Choosing Customized Marketing Offers to Attract a Desirable Mix of Customers,"Belloni, Alexandre and Lovett, Mitchell J. and Boulding, William and Staelin, Richard",MARKETING SCIENCE,31,4,621-636,2012,JUL-AUG,Choice Sets;College Choice;Utility On Averages;Statistical Approximation;Nonconvex Optimization,,"Each year in the postsecondary education industry, schools offer admission to nearly 3 million new students and scholarships totaling nearly $100 billion. This is a large, understudied targeted marketing and price discrimination problem. This problem falls into a broader class of configuration utility problems (CUPs), which typically require an approach tailored to exploit the particular setting. This paper provides such an approach for the admission and scholarship decisions problem. The approach accounts for the key distinguishing feature of this industry-schools value the average features of the matriculating students such as percent female, percent from different regions of the world, average test scores, and average grade point average. Thus, as in any CUP, the value of one object (i.e., student) cannot be separated from the composition of all of the objects (other students in the enrolling class). This goal of achieving a class with a desirable set of average characteristics greatly complicates the optimization problem and does not allow the application of standard approaches. We develop a new approach that solves this more complex optimization problem using an empirical system to estimate each student's choice and the focal school's utility function. We test the approach in a field study of an MBA scholarship process and implement adjusted scholarship decisions. Using a holdout sample, we provide evidence that the methodology can lead to improvements over current management decisions. Finally, by comparing our solution to what management would do on its own, we provide insight into how to improve management decisions in this setting.",Designing Ranking Systems for Hotels on Travel Search Engines by Mining User-Generated and Crowdsourced Content,"Ghose, Anindya and Ipeirotis, Panagiotis G. and Li, Beibei",MARKETING SCIENCE,31,"3, SI",493-520,2012,MAY-JUN,User-Generated Content;Social Media;Search Engines;Hotels;Ranking System;Structural Models;Text Mining;Crowdsourcing,,"User-generated content on social media platforms and product search engines is changing the way consumers shop for goods online. However, current product search engines fail to effectively leverage information created across diverse social media platforms. Moreover, current ranking algorithms in these product search engines tend to induce consumers to focus on one single product characteristic dimension (e.g., price, star rating). This approach largely ignores consumers' multidimensional preferences for products. In this paper, we propose to generate a ranking system that recommends products that provide, on average, the best value for the consumer's money. The key idea is that products that provide a higher surplus should be ranked higher on the screen in response to consumer queries. We use a unique data set of U.S. hotel reservations made over a three-month period through Travelocity, which we supplement with data from various social media sources using techniques from text mining, image classification, social geotagging, human annotations, and geomapping. We propose a random coefficient hybrid structural model, taking into consideration the two sources of consumer heterogeneity the different travel occasions and different hotel characteristics introduce. Based on the estimates from the model, we infer the economic impact of various location and service characteristics of hotels. We then propose a new hotel ranking system based on the average utility gain a consumer receives from staying in a particular hotel. By doing so, we can provide customers with the best-value hotels early on. Our user studies, using ranking comparisons from several thousand users, validate the superiority of our ranking system relative to existing systems on several travel search engines. On a broader note, this paper illustrates how social media can be mined and incorporated into a demand estimation model in order to generate a new ranking system in product search engines. We thus highlight the tight linkages between user behavior on social media and search engines. Our interdisciplinary approach provides several insights for using machine learning techniques in economics and marketing research.",Marketing Scholarship 2.0,"Lutz, Richard J.",JOURNAL OF MARKETING,75,4,225-234,2011,JUL,Scholarship;Open Source;Web 2.0;Academics;Practitioners,,"The system for the design, production, and dissemination of marketing scholarship aimed at contributing to marketing practice is under increasing strain due to pressures exerted by globalization, digitization, and environmentalism. Scholarly research in marketing adheres largely to a twentieth-century manufacturing model. Change is needed now. Marketing scholarship can benefit from embracing a twenty-first-century, collaborative approach to the conception, design, and dissemination of research. Crowdsourcing is becoming a frequently employed strategy in industry. Marketing academe should adopt some of the same techniques and technologies to make stronger research contributions that will benefit marketing practice. In particular, more collaboration is needed, both among academic researchers and between academe and industry, to be sure important problems are being investigated using sound theories and methods. An open, collaborative model will allow the field to evolve from Marketing Scholarship 1.0 to Marketing Scholarship 2.0."Not relevant,The Braggart's Dilemma: On the Social Rewards and Penalties of Advertising Prosocial Behavior,"Berman, Jonathan Z. and Levine, Emma E. and Barasch, Alixandra and Small, Deborah A.",JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH,52,1,90-104,2015,FEB,Prosocial Behavior;Altruism;Bragging;Self-Promotion;Signaling,,"People often brag about, or advertise, their good deeds to others. Seven studies investigate how bragging about prosocial behavior affects perceived generosity. The authors propose that bragging conveys information about an actor's good deeds, leading to an attribution of generosity. However, bragging also signals a selfish motivation (a desire for credit) that undermines the attribution of generosity. Thus, bragging has a positive effect when prosocial behavior is unknown because it informs others that an actor has behaved generously. However, bragging does not help-and often hurts-when prosocial behavior is already known, because it signals a selfish motive. In addition, the authors demonstrate that conspicuous cause marketing products have effects akin to bragging by signaling an impure motive for doing good deeds. Finally, the authors argue that bragging about prosocial behavior is unique because it undermines the precise information that the braggart is trying to convey (generosity). In contrast, bragging about personal achievements does not affect perceptions of the focal trait conveyed in the brag. These findings underscore the strategic considerations inherent in signaling altruism.",Efficient Choice Designs for a Consider-Then-Choose Model,"Liu, Qing and Arora, Neeraj",MARKETING SCIENCE,30,2,321-338,2011,MAR-APR,Experimental Design;Conjoint Choice Designs;D-Optimality;Consider-Then-Choose Model;Noncompensatory Screening Rules,,"Existing research on choice designs focuses exclusively on compensatory models that assume that all available alternatives are considered in the choice process. In this paper, we develop a method to construct efficient designs for a two-stage, consider-then-choose model that involves a noncompensatory screening process at the first stage and a compensatory choice process at the second stage. The method applies to both conjunctive and disjunctive screening rules. Under certain conditions, the method also applies to the subset conjunctive and disjunctions of conjunctions screening rules. Based on the local design criterion, we conduct a comparative study of compensatory and conjunctive designs-the former are optimized for a compensatory model and the latter for a two-stage model that uses conjunctive screening in its first stage. We find that conjunctive designs have higher level overlap than compensatory designs. This occurs because level overlap helps pinpoint screening behavior. Higher overlap of conjunctive designs is also accompanied by lower orthogonality, less level balance, and more utility balance. We find that compensatory designs have a significant loss of design efficiency when the true model involves conjunctive screening at the consideration stage. These designs also have much less power than conjunctive designs in identifying a true consider-then-choose process with conjunctive screening. In contrast, when the true model is compensatory, the efficiency loss from using a conjunctive design is lower. Also, conjunctive designs have about the same power as compensatory designs in identifying a true compensatory choice process. Our findings make a strong case for the use of conjunctive designs when there is prior evidence to support respondent screening."
