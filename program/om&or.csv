Others but relevant to OM,"Separation and Extension of Cover Inequalities for Conic Quadratic Knapsack Constraints with Generalized Upper Bounds","Atamtuerk, Alper and Muller, Laurent Flindt and Pisinger, David","INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING","25","3","420-431","2013","SUM","Programming: Integer;Nonlinear;Convex;Constraints;Computational Analysis","","Motivated by addressing probabilistic 0-1 programs we study the conic quadratic knapsack polytope with generalized upper bound (GUB) constraints. In particular, we investigate separating and extending GUB cover inequalities. We show that, unlike in the linear case, determining whether a cover can be extended with a single variable NP-hard. We describe and compare a number of exact and heuristic separation and extension algorithms which make use of the structure of the constraints. Computational experiments are performed for comparing the proposed separation and extension algorithms. These experiments show that a judicious application of the extended GUB cover cuts can reduce the solution time of conic quadratic 0-1 programs with GUB constraints substantially."
,"Critically Loaded Time-Varying Multiserver Queues: Computational Challenges and Approximations","Ko, Young Myoung and Gautam, Natarajan","INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING","25","2","285-301","2013","SPR","Transient Analysis;Multiserver Queues;Nearly Critically Loaded;Uniform Acceleration;Strong Approximations","","In this paper, we consider time-varying multiserver queues with abandonment and retrials. For their performance analysis, fluid and diffusion limits utilizing strong approximations have been widely used in the literature. Although those limits are asymptotically exact, they may not accurately approximate performance of multiserver queues even if the number of servers is large. To address that concern, this paper focuses on developing a methodology by taking fluid and diffusion limits in a nontraditional fashion. We show that our approximation is significantly more accurate and also asymptotically true. We illustrate the effectiveness of our methodology by performing several numerical experiments."
,"An Improved Primal Simplex Algorithm for Degenerate Linear Programs","Elhallaoui, Issmail and Metrane, Abdelmoutalib and Desaulniers, Guy and Soumis, Francois","INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING","23","4","569-577","2011","FAL","Linear Programming;Primal Simplex Algorithm;Degeneracy","","Since its appearance in 1947, the primal simplex algorithm has been one of the most popular algorithms for solving linear programs. It is often very efficient when there is very little degeneracy, but it often struggles in the presence of high degeneracy, executing many pivots without improving the objective function value. In this paper, we propose an improved primal simplex algorithm that deals with this issue. This algorithm is based on new theoretical results that shed light on how to reduce the negative impact of degeneracy. In particular, we show that, from a nonoptimal basic solution with p positive-valued variables, there exists a sequence of at most m - p + 1 simplex pivots that guarantee the improvement of the objective value, where m is the number of constraints in the linear program. These pivots can be identified by solving an auxiliary linear program. Finally, we briefly summarize computational results that show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on degenerate linear programs."
,"Predicting the Solution Time of Branch-and-Bound Algorithms for Mixed-Integer Programs","Oezaltin, Osman Y. and Hunsaker, Brady and Schaefer, Andrew J.","INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING","23","3","392-403","2011","SUM","Solution Time Prediction;Mixed-Integer Programming;Branch-And-Bound Algorithm","","The most widely used progress measure for branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithms when solving mixed-integer programs (MIPs) is the MIP gap. We introduce a new progress measure that is often much smoother than the MIP gap. We propose a double exponential smoothing technique to predict the solution time of B&B algorithms and evaluate the prediction method using three MIP solvers. Our computational experiments show that accurate predictions of the solution time are possible, even in the early stages of B&B algorithms."
,"Decision Support and Optimization in Shutdown and Turnaround Scheduling","Megow, Nicole and Moehring, Rolf H. and Schulz, Jens","INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING","23","2","189-204","2011","SPR","Project Management;Planning;Scheduling;Resource Constraints;Risk Analysis;Applications;Large-Scale Systems;Chemical Industries","","Large-scale maintenance in industrial plants requires the entire shutdown of production units for disassembly, comprehensive inspection, and renewal. We derive models and algorithms for this so-called turnaround scheduling that include different features such as time-cost trade-off, precedence constraints, external resource units, resource leveling, different working shifts, and risk analysis. We propose a framework for decision support that consists of two phases. The first phase supports the manager in finding a good makespan for the turnaround. It computes an approximate project time-cost trade-off curve together with a stochastic evaluation. Our risk measures are the expected tardiness at time t and the probability of completing the turnaround within time t. In the second phase, we solve the actual scheduling optimization problem for the makespan chosen in the first phase heuristically and compute a detailed schedule that respects all side constraints. Again, we complement this by computing upper bounds for the same two risk measures. Our experimental results show that our methods solve large real-world instances from chemical manufacturing plants quickly and yield an excellent resource utilization. A comparison with solutions of a mixed-integer program on smaller instances proves the high quality of the schedules that our algorithms produce within a few minutes."
,"Emergent clustering methods for empirical OM research","Brusco, Michael J. and Steinley, Douglas and Cradit, J. Dennis and Singh, Renu","JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT","30","6","454-466","2012","SEP","Cluster Analysis;Multivariate Statistics;Empirical Research Methods","","To date, the vast majority of cluster analysis applications in OM research have relied on traditional hierarchical (e.g.. Ward's algorithm) and nonhierarchical (e.g., K-means algorithms) methods. Although these venerable methods should continue to be employed effectively in the OM literature, we also believe there is a significant opportunity to expand the scope of clustering methods to emergent techniques. We provide an overview of some alternative clustering procedures (including advantages and disadvantages), identify software programs for implementing them, and discuss the circumstances where they might be employed gainfully in OM research. The implementation of emergent clustering methods in the OM literature should enable researchers to offer implications for practice that might not have been uncovered with traditional methods.

We focus specifically on returns management at the marketing-operations interface, by utilizing the conceptualization of customer value and its related drivers. In order to explore the phenomenon of returns management across a multi-disciplinary, managerial spectrum, a qualitative research methodology relying on individual managers' perceptions was chosen to generate depth of understanding given the limited current understanding of the research topic under consideration. Our results suggest that functional integration at the marketing-operations interface can lead to better alignment of corporate resources and thus create higher levels of customer value. We also found the external business environment to impact how and why a firm creates customer value through the returns management process. Overall, our results suggest that when returns management is recognized as a matter of a firm's competitiveness, the joint role of operations and marketing is imperative to success.

,"Operations management and corporate entrepreneurship: The moderating effect of operations control on the antecedents of corporate entrepreneurial activity in relation to innovation performance","Goodale, John C. and Kuratko, Donald F. and Hornsby, Jeffrey S. and Covin, Jeffrey G.","JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT","29","1-2, SI","116-127","2011","JAN","Operations Control;Corporate Entrepreneurship;Innovation","","Research on the topic of corporate entrepreneurship has expanded steadily over the last few decades, in large part due to the increasingly recognized linkages between product-market and technological innovation (i.e., consequences of corporate entrepreneurial activity) and firm success. Likewise, growing evidence suggests that effective operations control is a common quality of successful firms. On the surface the two phenomena corporate entrepreneurship and operations control may seem to be inherently at odds. That is, corporate entrepreneurship is aimed at taking the firm in new directions, while operations control is aimed at channeling and often restricting actions. As such, it would be useful to know how operations control variables act in concert with the determinants of corporate entrepreneurial activity to promote the innovation outcomes that facilitate long-term organizational success. In this study of 177 firms operating in a wide variety of industries, we investigate the effect on innovation performance of several commonly-acknowledged antecedents of corporate entrepreneurship, as measured by the Corporate Entrepreneurship Assessment Instrument (e.g., Hornsby et al., 2008, 2002); namely, management support, work discretion/autonomy, rewards/reinforcements, time availability, and organizational boundaries. More importantly, we examine the moderating effects of operations control variables specifically risk control and process control formality - on the relationships between the antecedents of corporate entrepreneurship and innovation performance. Results indicate that only two of the five antecedents to corporate entrepreneurship have main effects on innovation performance with moderate significance. However, each of the five antecedents significantly interacts with one or both of the operations control variables and, thereby, influences innovation performance. The implications of these results in relation to operations management and corporate entrepreneurship theory and practice are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
,"Pricing Time-Sensitive Services Based on Realized Performance","Afeche, Philipp and Baron, Opher and Kerner, Yoav","M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT","15","3","492-506","2013","SUM","Delay;Lead Times;Pricing;Queueing Systems;Revenue Management;Risk Aversion","","Services such as FedEx charge up-front fees but reimburse customers for delays. However, lead-time pricing studies ignore such delay refunds. This paper contributes to filling this gap. It studies revenue-maximizing tariffs that depend on realized lead times for a provider serving multiple time-sensitive customer types. We relax two key assumptions of the standard model in the lead-time pricing literature. First, customers may be risk averse (RA) with respect to payoff uncertainty, where payoff equals valuation, minus delay cost, minus payment. Second, tariffs may be arbitrary functions of realized lead times. The standard model assumes risk-neutral (RN) customers and restricts attention to flat rates. We report three main findings: (1) With RN customers, flat-rate pricing maximizes revenues but leaves customers exposed to payoff variability. (2) With RA customers, flat-rate pricing is suboptimal. If types are distinguishable, the optimal lead-time-dependent tariffs fully insure delay cost risk and yield the same revenue as under optimal flat rates for RN customers. With indistinguishable RA types, the differentiated first-best tariffs may be incentive-compatible even for uniform service, yielding higher revenues than with RN customers. (3) Under price and capacity optimization, lead-time-dependent pricing yields higher profits with less capacity compared to flat-rate pricing."
,"A Queueing Model to Evaluate the Impact of Patient Batching on Throughput and Flow Time in a Medical Teaching Facility","Dobson, Gregory and Lee, Hsiao-Hui and Sainathan, Arvind and Tilson, Vera","M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT","14","4, SI","584-599","2012","FAL","Tandem Queues;Concurrent Service;Finite Buffer;Batching;Flow Time Versus Throughput","","We consider the work flow in a medical teaching facility, examining the process that involves an initial patient exam by a resident physician, a subsequent conference between the resident and the attending physician, and the attending physician's visit with the patient. We create an analytical model of a tandem queue with finite buffer space to analyze the impact of different work prioritization policies on the throughput and the flow time of patients in the facility-measures that influence both the facility's finances and patients' satisfaction. We derive throughput-optimal policies and show that these policies involve dynamic batching. This finding is interesting because our model does not include any setup times, and setup times normally imply batching; rather it is the uncertain service times and the requirement for simultaneous service in the conference step that make batching optimal. The optimal dynamic batching policy is complex, so we consider a simpler static batching policy. We show that, in systems with limited buffer space, large batches can sometimes degrade efficiency by simultaneously increasing flow time and decreasing throughput. However, in general, both flow time and throughput increase with batch size. Flow time increases at a faster rate than throughput, so hospital management may want to consider what batch size is optimal given the value it places on the two measures."
,"Computing Bid Prices for Revenue Management Under Customer Choice Behavior","Chaneton, Juan M. and Vulcano, Gustavo","M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT","13","4","452-470","2011","FAL","Stochastic Gradient Methods;Simulation-Based Optimization;Choice Behavior;Network Capacity Control","","We consider a choice-based, network revenue management (RM) problem in a setting where heterogeneous customers consider an assortment of products offered by a firm (e. g., different flight times, fare classes, and/or routes). Individual choice decisions are modeled through an ordered list of preferences, and minimal assumptions are made about the statistical properties of this demand sequence. The firm manages the availability of products using a bid-price control strategy, and would like to optimize the control parameters. We formulate a continuous demand and capacity model for this problem that allows for the partial acceptance of requests. The model admits a simple calculation of the sample path gradient of the revenue function. This gradient is then used to construct a stochastic steepest ascent algorithm. We show that the algorithm converges (w.p.1) to a stationary point of the expected revenue function under mild conditions. The procedure is relatively efficient from a computational standpoint, and in our synthetic and real-data experiments performs comparably to or even better than other choice-based methods that are incompatible with the current infrastructure of RM systems. These features make it an interesting candidate to be pursued for real-world applications."
,"A Multiechelon Inventory Problem with Secondary Market Sales","Angelus, Alexandar","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","57","12","2145-2162","2011","DEC","Inventory Theory;Multiechelon;Stock Disposals;Secondary Markets;Dynamic Programming;Optimal Policy;Heuristics;Echelon Base-Stock Policy","","We consider a finite-horizon, multiechelon inventory system in which the surplus of stock can be sold (i.e., disposed) in the secondary markets at each stage in the system. What are called nested echelon order-up-to policies are shown to be optimal for jointly managing inventory replenishments and secondary market sales. Under a general restriction on model parameters, we establish that it is optimal not to both sell off excess stock and replenish inventory. Secondary market sales complicate the structure of the system, so that the classical Clark and Scarf echelon reformulation no longer allows for the decomposition of the objective function under the optimal policy. We introduce a novel class of policies, referred to as the disposal saturation policies, and show that there exists a disposal saturation policy, determined recursively by a single base-stock level at each echelon, that achieves the decomposition of this problem. The resulting optimal replenishment policy is shown to be the echelon base-stock policy. We demonstrate the heuristic performance of this disposal saturation policy through a series of numerical studies: except at extreme ranges of model parameters, the policy provides a very good approximation to the optimal policy while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. We also conduct numerical studies to determine the value of the secondary markets for multistage supply chains and assess its sensitivity to model parameters. The results provide potentially useful insights for companies seeking to enter or develop secondary markets for supply chains."
,"Evaluating Heuristics Used When Designing Product Costing Systems","Balakrishnan, Ramji and Hansen, Stephen and Labro, Eva","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","57","3","520-541","2011","MAR","Costing;Estimation;Activity-Based Costing;Cost Drivers;Cost Pools","","The academic and practitioner literature justifies firms' use of product costs in product pricing and capacity planning decisions as heuristics to address an otherwise intractable problem. However, product costs are the output of a cost reporting system, which itself is the outcome of heuristic design choices. In particular, because of informational limitations, when designing cost systems firms use simple rules of thumb to group resources into cost pools and to select drivers used to allocate the pooled costs to products. Using simulations, we examine how popular choices in costing system design influence the error in reported costs. Taking information needs into account, we offer alternative ways to translate the vague guidance in the literature to implementable methods. Specifically, we compare size-based rules for forming cost pools with more informationally demanding correlation-based rules and develop a blended method that performs well in terms of accuracy. In addition, our analysis suggests that significant gains can be made from using a composite driver rather than selecting a driver based on the consumption pattern for the largest resource only, especially when combined with correlation-based rules to group resources. We vary properties of the underlying cost structure (such as the skewness in resource costs, the traceability of resources to products, the sharing of resources across products, and the variance in resource consumption patterns) to address the generalizability of our findings and to show when different heuristics might be preferred."
,"Non-Stationary Stochastic Optimization","Besbes, Omar and Gur, Yonatan and Zeevi, Assaf","OPERATIONS RESEARCH","63","5","1227-1244","2015","SEP-OCT","Stochastic Approximation;Non-Stationary;Minimax Regret;Online Convex Optimization","","We consider a non-stationary variant of a sequential stochastic optimization problem, in which the underlying cost functions may change along the horizon. We propose a measure, termed variation budget, that controls the extent of said change, and study how restrictions on this budget impact achievable performance. We identify sharp conditions under which it is possible to achieve long-run average optimality and more refined performance measures such as rate optimality that fully characterize the complexity of such problems. In doing so, we also establish a strong connection between two rather disparate strands of literature: (1) adversarial online convex optimization and (2) the more traditional stochastic approximation paradigm (couched in a non-stationary setting). This connection is the key to deriving well-performing policies in the latter, by leveraging structure of optimal policies in the former. Finally, tight bounds on the minimax regret allow us to quantify the price of non-stationarity, which mathematically captures the added complexity embedded in a temporally changing environment versus a stationary one."

,"An Exact Algorithm for the Two-Dimensional Orthogonal Packing Problem with Unloading Constraints","Cote, Jean-Francois and Gendreau, Michel and Potvin, Jean-Yves","OPERATIONS RESEARCH","62","5","1126-1141","2014","SEP-OCT","","","This paper describes an exact algorithm for solving a two-dimensional orthogonal packing problem with unloading constraints, which occurs as a subproblem of mixed vehicle routing and loading problems. The packing considered in this work is basically a feasibility problem involving a single bin. The problem is addressed through a decomposition approach wherein a branch-and-cut algorithm is designed for solving a one-dimensional relaxation of the original problem. When an integer solution is found in the branching tree, a subsidiary problem is solved to identify a two-dimensional packing that does not lead to any overlap and satisfies the unloading constraints. Cuts are added when the subsidiary problem proves to be infeasible. Several preprocessing techniques aimed at reducing the size of the solution space and uncovering infeasibility are also described. A numerical comparison with the best known exact method is reported at the end based on benchmark instances."
,"CUT: A Multicriteria Approach for Concavifiable Preferences","Argyris, Nikolaos and Morton, Alec and Figueira, Jose Rui","OPERATIONS RESEARCH","62","3","633-642","2014","MAY-JUN","","","We consider the problem of helping a decision maker (DM) choose from a set of multiattributed objects when her preferences are concavifiable, i.e. representable by a concave value function. We establish conditions under which preferences or preference intensities are concavifiable. We also derive a characterization for the family of concave value functions compatible with a set of such preference statements expressed by the DM. This can be used to validate dominance relations over discrete sets of alternatives and forms the basis of an interactive procedure. We report on the practical use of this procedure with several DMs for a flat-choice problem and its computational performance on a set of project-portfolio selection problem instances. The use of preference intensities is found to provide significant improvements to the performance of the procedure."
,"Exploiting Erraticism in Search","Fischetti, Matteo and Monaci, Michele","OPERATIONS RESEARCH","62","1","114-122","2014","JAN-FEB","","","High sensitivity to initial conditions is generally viewed as a drawback of tree search methods because it leads to erratic behavior to be mitigated somehow. In this paper we investigate the opposite viewpoint and consider this behavior as an opportunity to exploit. Our working hypothesis is that erraticism is in fact just a consequence of the exponential nature of tree search that acts as a chaotic amplifier, so it is largely unavoidable. We propose a bet-and-run approach to actually turn erraticism to one's advantage. The idea is to make a number of short sample runs with randomized initial conditions, to bet on the most promising run selected according to certain simple criteria, and to bring it to completion. Computational results on a large testbed of mixed integer linear programs from the literature are presented, showing the potential of this approach even when embedded in a proof-of-concept implementation."
,"The Robust Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem Under Demand Uncertainty","Gounaris, Chrysanthos E. and Wiesemann, Wolfram and Floudas, Christodoulos A.","OPERATIONS RESEARCH","61","3","677-693","2013","MAY-JUN","","","The robust capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) under demand uncertainty is studied to address the minimum cost delivery of a product to geographically dispersed customers using capacity-constrained vehicles. Contrary to the deterministic CVRP, which postulates that the customer demands for the product are deterministic and known, the robust CVRP models the customer demands as random variables, and it determines a minimum cost delivery plan that is feasible for all anticipated demand realizations. Robust optimization counterparts of several deterministic CVRP formulations are derived and compared numerically. Robust rounded capacity inequalities are developed, and it is shown how they can be separated efficiently for two broad classes of demand supports. Finally, it is analyzed how the robust CVRP relates to the chance-constrained CVRP, which allows a controlled degree of supply shortfall to decrease delivery costs."
,"The Implicit Hitting Set Approach to Solve Combinatorial Optimization Problems with an Application to Multigenome Alignment","Moreno-Centeno, Erick and Karp, Richard M.","OPERATIONS RESEARCH","61","2","453-468","2013","MAR-APR","","","We develop a novel framework, the implicit hitting set approach, for solving a class of combinatorial optimization problems. The explicit hitting set problem is as follows: given a set U and a family S of subsets of U, find a minimum-cardinality set that intersects (hits) every set in S. In the implicit hitting set problem (IHSP), the family of subsets S is not explicitly listed (its size is, generally, exponential in terms of the size of U); instead, it is given via a polynomial-time oracle that verifies if a given set H is a hitting set or returns a set in S that is not hit by H. Many NP-hard problems can be straightforwardly formulated as implicit hitting set problems. We show that the implicit hitting set approach is valuable in developing exact and heuristic algorithms for solving this class of combinatorial optimization problems. Specifically, we provide a generic algorithmic strategy, which combines efficient heuristics and exact methods, to solve any IHSP. Given an instance of an IHSP, the proposed algorithmic strategy gives a sequence of feasible solutions and lower bounds on the optimal solution value and ultimately yields an optimal solution. We specialize this algorithmic strategy to solve the multigenome alignment problem and present computational results that illustrate the effectiveness of the implicit hitting set approach."
,"Multiple Objectives Satisficing Under Uncertainty","Lam, Shao-Wei and Tsan Sheng Ng and Sim, Melvyn and Song, Jin-Hwa","OPERATIONS RESEARCH","61","1","214-227","2013","JAN-FEB","","","We propose a class of functions, called multiple objective satisficing (MOS) criteria, for evaluating the level of compliance of a set of objectives in meeting their targets collectively under uncertainty. The MOS criteria include the joint targets' achievement probability (joint success probability criterion) as a special case and also extend to situations when the probability distributions are not fully characterized. We focus on a class of MOS criteria that favors diversification, which has the potential to mitigate severe shortfalls in scenarios when any objective fails to achieve its target. Naturally, this class excludes joint success probability. We further propose the shortfall-aware MOS criterion (S-MOS), which is inspired by the probability measure and is diversification favoring. We also show how to build tractable approximations of the S-MOS criterion. Because the S-MOS criterion maximization is not a convex optimization problem, we propose improvement algorithms via solving sequences of convex optimization problems. We report encouraging computational results on a blending problem in meeting specification targets even in the absence of full probability distribution description."
,"Stabilizing Customer Abandonment in Many-Server Queues with Time-Varying Arrivals","Liu, Yunan and Whitt, Ward","OPERATIONS RESEARCH","60","6","1551-1564","2012","NOV-DEC","","","An algorithm is developed to determine time-dependent staffing levels to stabilize the time-dependent abandonment probabilities and expected delays at positive target values in the M-1/GI/s(1) + GI many-server queueing model, which has a nonhomogeneous Poisson arrival process (the M-1), has general service times (the first GI), and allows customer abandonment according to a general patience distribution (the +GI). New offered-load and modified-offered-load approximations involving infinite-server models are developed for that purpose. Simulations show that the approximations are effective. A many-server heavy-traffic limit in the efficiency-driven regime shows that (i) the proposed approximations achieve the goal asymptotically as the scale increases, and (ii) it is not possible to simultaneously stabilize the mean queue length in the same asymptotic regime."
,"An Overloaded Multiclass FIFO Queue with Abandonments","Jennings, Otis B. and Reed, Josh E.","OPERATIONS RESEARCH","60","5","1282-1295","2012","SEP-OCT","","","In this paper we consider a single-server queue fed by K independent renewal arrival streams, each representing a different job class. Jobs are processed in a FIFO fashion, regardless of class. The total amount of work arriving to the system exceeds the server's capacity. That is, the nominal traffic intensity of the system is assumed to be greater than one. Jobs arriving to the system grow impatient and abandon the queue after a random amount of time if service has not yet begun. Interarrival, service, and abandonment times are assumed to be generally distributed and class specific. We approximate this system using both fluid and diffusion limits. To this end, we consider a sequence of systems indexed by n in which the arrival and service rates are proportional to n; the abandonment distribution remains fixed across the sequence. In our first main result, we show that in the limit as n tends to infinity, the virtual waiting time process converges to a limiting deterministic process. This limit may be characterized as the solution to a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE). Specific examples are then presented for which the ODE may be explicitly solved. In our second main result, we refine the deterministic fluid approximation by showing that the fluid-centered and diffusion-scaled virtual waiting time process weakly converges to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process whose drift and infinitesimal variance both vary over time. This process may also be solved for explicitly, thus yielding approximations to the transient as well as steady-state behavior of the virtual waiting time process."
,"A New Algorithm for the Open-Pit Mine Production Scheduling Problem","Chicoisne, Renaud and Espinoza, Daniel and Goycoolea, Marcos and Moreno, Eduardo and Rubio, Enrique","OPERATIONS RESEARCH","60","3","517-528","2012","MAY-JUN","","","For the purpose of production scheduling, open-pit mines are discretized into three-dimensional arrays known as block models. Production scheduling consists of deciding which blocks should be extracted, when they should be extracted, and what to do with the blocks once they are extracted. Blocks that are close to the surface should be extracted first, and capacity constraints limit the production in each time period. Since the 1960s, it has been known that this problem can be cast as an integer programming model. However, the large size of some real instances (3-10 million blocks, 15-20 time periods) has made these models impractical for use in real planning applications, thus leading to the use of numerous heuristic methods. In this article we study a well-known integer programming formulation of the problem that we refer to as C-PIT. We propose a new decomposition method for solving the linear programming relaxation (LP) of C-PIT when there is a single capacity constraint per time period. This algorithm is based on exploiting the structure of the precedence-constrained knapsack problem and runs in O(mn log n) in which n is the number of blocks and m a function of the precedence relationships in the mine. Our computations show that we can solve, in minutes, the LP relaxation of real-sized mine-planning applications with up to five million blocks and 20 time periods. Combining this with a quick rounding algorithm based on topological sorting, we obtain integer feasible solutions to the more general problem where multiple capacity constraints per time period are considered. Our implementation obtains solutions within 6% of optimality in seconds. A second heuristic step, based on local search, allows us to find solutions within 3% in one hour on all instances considered. For most instances, we obtain solutions within 1-2% of optimality if we let this heuristic run longer. Previous methods have been able to tackle only instances with up to 150,000 blocks and 15 time periods."
,"Approximate Dynamic Programming via a Smoothed Linear Program","Desai, Vijay V. and Farias, Vivek F. and Moallemi, Ciamac C.","OPERATIONS RESEARCH","60","3","655-674","2012","MAY-JUN","","","We present a novel linear program for the approximation of the dynamic programming cost-to-go function in high-dimensional stochastic control problems. LP approaches to approximate DP have typically relied on a natural projection of a well-studied linear program for exact dynamic programming. Such programs restrict attention to approximations that are lower bounds to the optimal cost-to-go function. Our program-the smoothed approximate linear program-is distinct from such approaches and relaxes the restriction to lower bounding approximations in an appropriate fashion while remaining computationally tractable. Doing so appears to have several advantages: First, we demonstrate bounds on the quality of approximation to the optimal cost-to-go function afforded by our approach. These bounds are, in general, no worse than those available for extant LP approaches and for specific problem instances can be shown to be arbitrarily stronger. Second, experiments with our approach on a pair of challenging problems (the game of Tetris and a queueing network control problem) show that the approach outperforms the existing LP approach (which has previously been shown to be competitive with several ADP algorithms) by a substantial margin."

,"Projected Perspective Reformulations with Applications in Design Problems","Frangioni, Antonio and Gentile, Claudio and Grande, Enrico and Pacifici, Andrea","OPERATIONS RESEARCH","59","5","1225-1232","2011","SEP-OCT","","","The perspective relaxation (PR) is a general approach for constructing tight approximations to mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLP) with semicontinuous variables. The PR of a MINLP can be formulated either as a mixed-integer second-order cone program (MI-SOCP), provided that the original objective function is SOCP-representable, or as a semi-infinite MINLP. In this paper, we show that under some further assumptions (rather restrictive, but satisfied in several practical applications), the PR of a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) can also be reformulated as a piecewise-quadratic program (QP), ultimately yielding a QP relaxation of roughly the same size of the standard continuous relaxation. Furthermore, if the original problem has some exploitable structure, then this structure is typically preserved in the reformulation, thus allowing the construction of specialized approaches for solving the PR.

G. and Dekker, Rommert","PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT","24","10","1580-1597","2015","OCT","Service Parts;Contract Expirations;Inventory;Obsolescence;After Sales","","The majority of after-sales service providers manage their service parts inventory by focusing on the availability of service parts. This approach, combined with automatic replenishment systems, leads to reactive inventory control policies where base stock levels are adjusted only after a service contract expires. Consequently, service providers often face excess stock of critical service parts that are difficult to dispose due to their specificity. In this study, we address this problem by developing inventory control policies taking into account contract expirations. Our key idea is to reduce the base stock level of the one-for-one policy before obsolescence (a full or partial drop in demand rate) occurs and let demand take away excess stock. We refer to this policy as the single-adjustment policy. We benchmark the single-adjustment policy with the multiple-adjustment policy (allowing multiple base stock adjustments) formulated as a dynamic program and verify that for a wide range of instances the single-adjustment policy is an effective heuristic for the multiple-adjustment policy. We also compare the single-adjustment policy with the world-dependent base stock policy offered by Song and Zipkin (1993) and identify the parameter combinations where both policies yield similar costs. We consider two special cases of the single-adjustment policy where the base stock level is kept fixed or the base stock adjustment is postponed to the contract expiration time. We find that the initial demand rate, contract expiration time, and size of the drop in demand rate are the three key parameters driving the choice between the single-adjustment policy and its special cases."
,"Distribution Planning to Optimize Profits in the Motion Picture Industry","Somlo, Barbara and Rajaram, Kumar and Ahmadi, Reza","PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT","20","4","618-636","2011","JUL-AUG","Motion Picture Industry;Forecasting;Distribution Planning;Theater Selection;Optimization","","We consider the distribution planning problem in the motion picture industry. This problem involves forecasting theater-level box office revenues for a given movie and using these forecasts to choose the best locations to screen a movie. We first develop a method that predicts theater-level box office revenues over time for a given movie as a function of movie attributes and theater characteristics. These estimates are then used by the distributor to choose where to screen the movie. The distributor's location selection problem is modeled as an integer programming-based optimization model that chooses the location of theaters in order to optimize profits. We tested our methods on realistic box office data and show that it has the potential to significantly improve the distributor's profits. We also develop some insights into why our methods outperform existing practice, which are crucial to their successful practical implementation."
,"Advance Selling by a Newsvendor Retailer","Prasad, Ashutosh and Stecke, Kathryn E. and Zhao, Xuying","PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT","20","1","129-142","2011","JAN-FEB","Advance Selling;Newsvendor;Consumer Valuation;Uncertainty;Pricing","","Retailers often face a newsvendor problem. Advance selling helps retailers to reduce demand uncertainty. Consumers, however, may prefer not to purchase in advance unless given a discount because they are uncertain about their valuation for the product in advance. It is then unclear whether or when advance selling to pass some uncertainty risk to consumers is optimal for the retailer. This paper examines the advance selling price and inventory decisions in a two-period setting, where the first period is the advance selling period and the second is the selling (and consumption) period. We find that an advance selling strategy is not always optimal, but is contingent on parameters of the market (e.g., market potential and uncertainty) and the consumers (e.g., valuation, risk aversion, and heterogeneity). For example, we find that retailers should sell in advance if the consumers' expected valuation exceeds consumers' expected surplus when not buying early by a certain threshold. This threshold increases with the degree of risk aversion but decreases with stock out risk. If the degree of risk aversion varies across consumers, then a retailer should sell in advance if the probability for a consumer to spot buy is less than a critical fractile."
,"A Dynamic Disaggregation Approach to Approximate Linear Programs for Network Revenue Management","Vossen, Thomas W. M. and Zhang, Dan","PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT","24","3","469-487","2015","MAR","Network Revenue Management;Choice Behavior;Dynamic Programming;Linear Programming","","The linear programming approach to approximate dynamic programming has received considerable attention in the recent network revenue management (RM) literature. A major challenge of the approach lies in solving the resulting approximate linear programs (ALPs), which often have a huge number of constraints and/or variables. Starting from a recently developed compact affine ALP for network RM, we develop a novel dynamic disaggregation algorithm to solve the problem, which combines column and constraint generation and exploits the structure of the underlying problem. We show that the formulation can be further tightened by considering structural properties satisfied by an optimal solution. We prove that the sum of dynamic bid-prices across resources is concave over time. We also give a counterexample to demonstrate that the dynamic bid-prices of individual resources are not concave in general. Numerical experiments demonstrate that dynamic disaggregation is often orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms in the literature for problem instances with and without choice. In addition, adding the concavity constraints can further speed up the algorithm, often by an order of magnitude, for problem instances with choice."
,"Benefits of Hybrid Lateral Transshipments in Multi-Item Inventory Systems under Periodic Replenishment","Glazebrook, Kevin and Paterson, Colin and Rauscher, Sandra and Archibald, Thomas","PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT","24","2","311-324","2015","FEB","Inventory Control;Multi-Item;Lateral Transshipments;Dynamic Programming","","Lateral transshipments are a method of responding to shortages of stock in a network of inventory-holding locations. Conventional reactive approaches only seek to meet immediate shortages. The study proposes hybrid transshipments which exploit economies of scale by moving additional stock between locations to prevent future shortages in addition to meeting immediate ones. The setting considered is motivated by retailers who operate networks of outlets supplying car parts via a system of periodic replenishment. It is novel in allowing non-stationary stochastic demand and general patterns of dependence between multiple item types. The generality of our work makes it widely applicable. We develop an easy-to-compute quasi-myopic heuristic for determining how hybrid transshipments should be made. We obtain simple characterizations of the heuristic and demonstrate its strong cost performance in both small and large networks in an extensive numerical study."

Equivalent linear programs are formulated for the corresponding stochastic dynamic programs, and integrality results are derived based on the total unimodularity of the constraint matrices. Specifically, for all these models, starting with integer inventory levels, we show that there exist optimal policies that are integral. For the most general single-product, multi-echelon assembly system model, integrality results are also derived for a practical alternative to stochastic dynamic programming, namely, rolling-horizon optimization by a similar argument. We also present a different approach to prove integrality results for stochastic inventory models. This new approach is based on a generalization we propose for the one-dimensional notion of piecewise linearity with integer breakpoints to higher dimensions. The usefulness of this new approach is illustrated by establishing the integrality of both the dynamic programming and rolling-horizon optimization models of a two-product capacitated stochastic inventory control system."

The problem is especially challenging when the complementary technologies have uncertain cost reduction potentials. The entrepreneurship literature suggests that startups should pursue focused strategies for various reasons, including bounded rationality and budget constraints, but generally overlooks startups entering markets with complementary technologies. The advice for mature firms investing in complementary technologies is often to diversify investment across multiple complements to manage technological uncertainty. Given competing guidance, we seek to extend the entrepreneurship literature by modeling startups' entry decisions for markets in which complementary technologies exhibit strong learning effects. We find that, consistent with the extant entrepreneurship literature, startups generally achieve higher expected returns by channeling their integration investment to only one complementary technology. However, the mechanisms driving our results differ significantly by hinging on nonlinear feedback effects that occur when firms concentrate integration investment in only one complementary technology. Interestingly, this focused strategy often does not yield the highest market share or the lowest likelihood of bankruptcy. We characterize the situations under which each finding holds and describe the implications of these findings for theory, practice, and policy."

One of the sequential approaches to which the simultaneous approach is compared is a so-called first-come-first-served (FCFS) approach, i.e., an approach that generates randomized production policies that do not depend on the deterioration state of the machine. However, the model formulation for this approach does not generate policies consistent with this FCFS notion. Therefore, we present a revised FCFS model and analyze its performance using an existing experimental design. The results suggest that previous work overestimates the degree to which a FCFS approach is suboptimal, and underestimates the value of simultaneously optimizing the maintenance and production decisions. Lastly, we conduct additional experiments which suggest that the joint impact of using both simultaneous optimization and a deterioration dependent production policy is quite significant."

Miguel","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","58","11","2037-2056","2012","NOV","Marketing;Pricing;Search Costs;Information;Learning","","Consumers often need to search for product information before making purchase decisions. We consider a tractable (continuous-time) model of gradual learning, in which consumers incur search costs to learn further product information, and update their expected utility of the product at each search occasion. We characterize the optimal stopping rules for either purchase, or no purchase, as a function of search costs and of the importance/informativeness of each attribute. This paper also characterizes how the likelihood of purchase changes with the ex ante expected utility, search costs, and the importance/informativeness of each attribute. We discuss optimal pricing, the impact of consumer search on profits and social welfare, and how the seller chooses its price to strategically affect the extent of the consumers' search behavior. We show that lower search costs can hurt the consumer because the seller may then choose to charge higher prices. Discounting creates asymmetry in the purchase and no-purchase search thresholds, and may lead to lower prices if search occurs in equilibrium, or higher prices if there is no search in equilibrium. This paper also considers searching for signals of the value of the product, heterogeneous importance of attributes, endogenous intensity of search, and social learning."

Focusing on the case of ecolabels for environmental quality, we show how even small amounts of uncertainty can create consumer confusion that reduces or eliminates the value to firms of adopting voluntary labels. First, consumers are most suspicious of a label when a product with a bad reputation has it, so labels are often unpersuasive at showing that a seemingly bad product is actually good. Second, label proliferation aggravates the effect of uncertainty, causing the informativeness of labels to decrease rather than increase. Third, uncertainty makes labeling and nonlabeling equilibria more likely to coexist as the number of labels increases, so consumers face greater strategic uncertainty over how to interpret the presence or absence of a label. Finally, a label can be legitimitized or spoiled for other products when a product with a good or bad reputation displays it, so firms may adopt labels strategically to manipulate such information spillovers, which further exacerbates label confusion. Managers can reduce label confusion by supporting mandatory labeling or by undertaking investments to make certain labels focal."
,"An Investigation of Earnings Management Through Marketing Actions","Chapman, Craig J. and Steenburgh, Thomas J.","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","57","1","72-92","2011","JAN","Accounting;Marketing;Pricing;Promotion;Real Earnings Management","","Prior research hypothesizes managers use real actions, including the reduction of discretionary expenditures, to manage earnings to meet or beat key benchmarks. This paper examines this hypothesis by testing how different types of marketing expenditures are used to boost earnings for a durable commodity consumer product that can be easily stockpiled by end consumers. Combining supermarket scanner data with firm-level financial data, we find evidence that differs from prior literature. Instead of reducing expenditures to boost earnings, soup manufacturers roughly double the frequency and change the mix of marketing promotions (price discounts, feature advertisements, and aisle displays) at the fiscal quarter-end when they have greater incentive to boost earnings. Our results confirm managers' stated willingness to sacrifice long-term value in order to smooth earnings and their stated preference to use real actions to boost earnings to meet different types of earnings benchmarks. We estimate that marketing actions can be used to boost quarterly net income by up to 5% depending on the depth and duration of promotion. However, there is a price to pay, with the cost in the following period being approximately 7.5% of quarterly net income. Finally, a unique aspect of the research setting allows tests of who is responsible for the earnings management. Although firms appear unable to increase the frequency of aisle display promotions in the short run, they can reallocate these promotions within their portfolio of brands. Results show firms shifting display promotions away from smaller revenue brands toward larger ones following periods of poor financial performance. This indicates the behavior is determined by parties above brand managers in the firm. These findings are consistent with firms engaging in real earnings management and suggest that effects on subsequent reporting periods and competitor behavior are greater than previously documented."

Costless hyperlinking has enabled new types of players, usually referred to as content aggregators, to successfully enter content ecosystems, attracting traffic and revenue by hosting links to the content of others. This, in turn, has sparked a heated controversy between content creators and aggregators regarding the legitimacy and costs/benefits of uninhibited free linking. To our knowledge, this work is the first to model the complex interplay between content and links in settings where a set of sites compete for traffic. We develop a series of analytical models that distill how hyperlinking affects the (a) incentives of content nodes to produce quality content versus link to third-party content, (b) profits of the various stakeholders, (c) average quality of content that becomes available to consumers, and (d) impact of content aggregators. Our results provide a nuanced view of the so-called link economy, highlighting both the beneficial consequences and the drawbacks of free hyperlinks for content creators and consumers."

We describe different classes of valid inequalities for the new formulation and a column generation method to compute a valid lower bound embedded into an exact branch-and-price algorithm.

We further show that coaches implement significantly more offensive substitutions if their teams are behind expectations. Both types of behaviors impair the expected ultimate match outcome of the team, which shows that our findings do not simply reflect fully rational responses to reference-dependent incentive schemes of favorite teams to falling behind. We derive these results in a data set that contains more than 8,200 matches from 12 seasons of the German Bundesliga and 12 seasons of the English Premier League."
,"Advance Selling: Effects of Interdependent Consumer Valuations and Seller's Capacity","Yu, Man and Kapuscinski, Roman and Ahn, Hyun-Soo","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","61","9","2100-2117","2015","SEP","Advance Selling;Interdependent Valuation;Capacity Rationing","","We examine the impact of consumer valuation interdependence and capacity on a firm's optimal selling strategies. We consider a seller who can offer a single product to consumers twice, in advance and in spot. Consumers choose whether and when to buy, but if they buy in advance, they are uncertain about their own valuations. Whether they buy in advance or in spot, consumers' valuations are realized in the spot period and they may range from fully independent to perfectly correlated, creating markets with different characteristics of aggregate demand for the seller. Facing these consumers, the seller chooses a portion of the total capacity to offer in advance and prices in both periods. We describe how the optimal strategy and benefits of advance selling depend on the interdependence of consumer valuation, as well as capacity level and other market parameters. We find that a change in valuation interdependence can lead to dramatically different policies for the seller. For example, when individual valuations are highly diverse and the consumer population is large, the seller must offer a discount during advance selling but may limit the advance sales. On the other hand, when valuations are highly correlated, the seller can charge a premium price during advance selling. For the same valuation interdependence, the qualitative nature of the optimal strategy changes with available capacity."

Typically these parameters are elicited by presenting decision makers with a series of static choices between alternatives, gambles, or delayed payments. The proposed method dynamically (i.e., adaptively) designs such choices to optimize the information provided by each choice, while leveraging the distribution of the parameters across decision makers (heterogeneity) and capturing response error. We explore the convergence and the validity of our approach using simulations. The simulations suggest that the proposed method recovers true parameter values well under various circumstances. We then use an online experiment to compare our approach to a standard one used in the literature that requires comparable task completion time. We assess predictive accuracy in an out-of-sample task and completion time for both methods. For risk preferences, our results indicate that the proposed method predicts subjects' willingness to pay for a set of out-of-sample gambles significantly more accurately, while taking respondents about the same time to complete. For time preferences, both methods predict out-of-sample preferences equally well, while the proposed method takes significantly less completion time. For risk and time preferences, average completion time for our approach is approximately three minutes. Finally, we briefly review three applications that used the proposed methodology with various populations, and we discuss the potential benefits of the proposed methodology for research and practice."

This paper introduces a new risk tool to communicate the risk of investment products, and it examines how different risk-presentation modes influence risk-taking behavior and investors' recall ability of the risk-return profile of financial products. We analyze four different ways of communicating risk: (i) numerical descriptions, (ii) experience sampling, (iii) graphical displays, and (iv) a combination of these formats in the risk tool. Participants receive information about a risky and a risk-free fund and make an allocation between the two in an experimental investment portfolio. We find that risky allocations are elevated in both the risk tool and experience sampling conditions. Greater risky allocations in the risk tool condition are associated with decreased risk perception, increased confidence in the risky fund, and a lower estimation of the probability of a loss. In addition to these favorable perceptions of the risky fund, participants in the risk tool condition are more accurate on recall questions regarding the expected return and the probability of a loss. We find no evidence of greater dissatisfaction with returns in these conditions, and we observe a willingness to take on similar levels of risk in subsequent allocations."

We propose a numerical procedure that combines the abstract idea of artificial, unconstrained complete markets, well-known closed-form solutions in affine or quadratic return models, straightforward Monte Carlo simulation, and a standard iterative optimization routine. Our method provides an upper bound on the wealth-equivalent loss compared to the unknown optimal strategy, and it facilitates our understanding of the economic forces at play by building on closed-form expressions for the strategies considered. We illustrate and test our method on the life-cycle problem of an individual who receives unspanned labor income and cannot borrow or short sell. The upper loss bound is small, and our method performs well in comparison with two existing methods."

Based on surveys gathered from 140 employees in a division of a global chemical company, we found that direct knowledge and reflected knowledge enhanced trust in distinct ways. Although both enhanced feelings of closeness with others, results indicate that direct knowledge increased focal actors' understanding of their distant colleagues, whereas reflected knowledge promoted feelings of being understood. We discuss implications of reflected knowledge to theories of trust and interpersonal dynamics in globally distributed collaboration."

We allow bloggers to differ along two dimensions: (1) the ability to post news-breaking content, and (2) the ability to find news in other blogs. By linking, a blog signals to the reader that it will be able to direct her to news in other blogs in the future. The downside of a link is that it is a positive signal on the rival's news-breaking ability. We show that linking will be in equilibrium when the heterogeneity on the ability to break news is low relative to the heterogeneity on the ability to find news in other blogs. One implication of the linking mechanism is that blogs that are high on the news-breaking ability are more likely to gain readers. Hence, despite the fact that bloggers link for purely selfish reasons, the macro effects of this activity is that readers' learning is enhanced."

Whereas one might expect entrepreneurs to perform better in these regions because of their richer endowments of regionally embedded social capital, they might also perform worse if their location choices rather reflect a preference for spending time with family and friends. We examine this question using comprehensive data on Danish start-ups. Ventures perform better-survive longer and generate greater annual profits and cash flows-when located in regions in which their founders have lived longer. This effect appears substantial, similar in size to the value of prior experience in the industry (i.e., to being a spin-off)."

We combine the G/G with a negative binomial distribution (NBD) and obtain the moments of the distribution of the number of transactions over (0, T] and (T, T + T{*}]. Out of six data sets, the G/G/NBD model provides a notable improvement in the log-likelihood over the Pareto/NBD model in four data sets. It can indicate substantial differences in expected residual lifetimes compared to the Pareto/NBD and induce a retention rather than acquisition policy. On the average, the G/G/NBD exhibits slightly better forecasts of the mean number of transactions than the Pareto/NBD."
,"On Evaluation Costs in Strategic Factor Markets: The Implications for Competition and Organizational Design","Ross, David Gaddis","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","58","4","791-804","2012","APR","Strategy;Organizational Studies;Design;Motivation-Incentives","","This paper uses a formal model to study how evaluation costs affect competition for resources in strategic factor markets. It finds that relative scarcity may not always benefit resource sellers. Rather, when competition among resource investors passes a certain threshold intensity, miscoordination among investors increases to the point that sellers' expected profits decline. This paper extends the model to consider how investors organize to overcome managerial agency in resource evaluation. Two organizational designs are considered: (a) incentivization, wherein a lower-level manager is motivated by an incentive contract to evaluate resources for an investor, and (b) supervision, wherein evaluation is either handled directly or closely monitored by headquarters. The model suggests that competition among investors will be associated with a greater use of supervision and that investors using supervision will tend to make lower offers. This paper also finds that supervision will be more common when valuable resources are rare."

Sampling is used to infer the unknown performance of several alternatives before one alternative is selected as best. This paper presents new economically motivated fully sequential sampling procedures to solve such problems, called economics of selection procedures. The optimal procedure is derived for comparing a known standard with one alternative whose unknown reward is inferred with sampling. That result motivates heuristics when multiple alternatives have unknown rewards. The resulting procedures are more effective in numerical experiments than any previously proposed procedure of which we are aware and are easily implemented. The key driver of the improvement is the use of dynamic programming to model sequential sampling as an option to learn before selecting an alternative. It accounts for the expected benefit of adaptive stopping policies for sampling, rather than of one-stage policies, as is common in the literature."

Using a utility formulation inspired by regret theory, we derive closed-form solutions. When the degree of foreign aversion is high in a given country, investors place a high valuation on domestic equity, which results in a low expected return. Thus, the model generates the simple prediction that a country's degree of home bias and the expected return of its domestic assets should be inversely related. Our predicted relation between the degree of home bias and a country's expected return has the opposite sign predicted by models that assume some form of market segmentation. Using International Monetary Fund portfolio data, we find that expected returns are negatively related to home bias."

The skewness effect is stronger during periods of high investor sentiment and is related to differences in skewness across industries as well as to time-series variation in the level of skewness in the market. IPOs with high expected skewness earn more negative abnormal returns in the following one to five years. High expected skewness is also associated with a higher fraction of small-sized trades on the first day of trading, which is consistent with a greater shift in holdings from institutions to individuals. The results suggest that first-day IPO returns are related to a preference for skewness."

We find that markets structured to have a fixed sequence of trades exhibit greater accuracy of information aggregation than the typical form that has unstructured trade. In comparing two commonly used mechanisms, we find no significant difference between the performance of the direct probability-report form and the indirect security-trading form of the market scoring rule. In the case of the markets with a structured order, we find evidence supporting the theoretical prediction that information aggregation is slower when information is complementary. In structured markets, the theoretical prediction that there will be more delayed trading in complementary markets is supported, but we find no support for the prediction that there will be more bluffing in complementary markets. However, the theoretical predictions are not borne out in the unstructured markets."

We exploit the timing of new fund launches in the hedge fund industry to distinguish between agency and capability effects in firm product diversification decisions, using a large survivor-bias-free panel data set on the hedge fund industry from 1994 to 2006. Empirically we show that diversifying firms' excess returns are high relative to those of other firms prior to diversification and fall within firm following diversification, but are six basis points higher per month per unit of risk ex post compared to a matched sample of focused firms. The evidence suggests that managers exploit asymmetric information about their own ability to time diversification decisions; yet, the discipline of markets ensures that better firms diversify, on average. The results provide large-sample empirical evidence that agency effects and firm capabilities jointly influence diversification decisions."
,"Dynamic Portfolio Optimization with Transaction Costs: Heuristics and Dual Bounds","Brown, David B. and Smith, James E.","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","57","10","1752-1770","2011","OCT","Dynamic Programming;Portfolio Optimization","","W e consider the problem of dynamic portfolio optimization in a discrete-time, finite-horizon setting. Our general model considers risk aversion, portfolio constraints (e. g., no short positions), return predictability, and transaction costs. This problem is naturally formulated as a stochastic dynamic program. Unfortunately, with nonzero transaction costs, the dimension of the state space is at least as large as the number of assets, and the problem is very difficult to solve with more than one or two assets. In this paper, we consider several easy-to-compute heuristic trading strategies that are based on optimizing simpler models. We complement these heuristics with upper bounds on the performance with an optimal trading strategy. These bounds are based on the dual approach developed in Brown et al. (Brown, D. B., J. E. Smith, P. Sun. 2009. Information relaxations and duality in stochastic dynamic programs. Oper. Res. 58(4) 785-801). In this context, these bounds are given by considering an investor who has access to perfect information about future returns but is penalized for using this advance information. These heuristic strategies and bounds can be evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation. We evaluate these heuristics and bounds in numerical experiments with a risk-free asset and 3 or 10 risky assets. In many cases, the performance of the heuristic strategy is very close to the upper bound, indicating that the heuristic strategies are very nearly optimal."
,"CEO Overconfidence and Innovation","Galasso, Alberto and Simcoe, Timothy S.","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","57","8","1469-1484","2011","AUG","Innovation;R&D;Ceo Overconfidence;Managerial Biases","","Are the attitudes and beliefs of chief executive officers (CEOs) linked to their firms' innovative performance? This paper uses a measure of overconfidence, based on CEO stock-option exercise, to study the relationship between a CEO's revealed beliefs about future performance and standard measures of corporate innovation. We begin by developing a career concern model where CEOs innovate to provide evidence of their ability. The model predicts that overconfident CEOs, who underestimate the probability of failure, are more likely to pursue innovation, and that this effect is larger in more competitive industries. We test these predictions on a panel of large publicly traded firms for the years from 1980 to 1994. We find a robust positive association between overconfidence and citation-weighted patent counts in both cross-sectional and fixed-effect models. This effect is larger in more competitive industries. Our results suggest that overconfident CEOs are more likely to take their firms in a new technological direction."
,"Anticipatory Sorting and Gender Segregation in Temporary Employment","Fernandez-Mateo, Isabel and King, Zella","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","57","6","989-1008","2011","JUN","Organizational Studies;Personnel;Hiring;Gender Stratification","","We examine the roots of gender segregation in the screening process by using a longitudinal data set of candidates considered for temporary projects at a staffing firm and following their progress through the hiring pipeline. Theories invoked to explain gender segregation across jobs traditionally rely on firm-specific human capital and expectations of future commitment to explain this phenomenon. These do not apply in this setting. Yet we find that the staffing firm is more likely to shortlist women for low-paid projects and less likely to do so for high-paid ones. These effects are due to women being considered for different projects than men, and associated at least partially to the level of competition within vacancies. Although client companies also exhibit some gender-sorting behavior in the later steps of the hiring process, they are more likely to prefer women and less likely to sort them into lower-paid projects. Our findings are consistent with anticipatory gender-sorting mechanisms, by which first screeners generate segregation when narrowing down the pool of candidates for later decision makers. We discuss the implications of this case for theories of gender stratification and workplace inequality, especially in mediated labor markets."

In this approach, an outer simulation is used to generate financial scenarios, and an inner simulation is used to estimate future portfolio values in each scenario. We focus on one risk measure, the probability of a large loss, and we propose a new algorithm to estimate this risk. Our algorithm sequentially allocates computational effort in the inner simulation based on marginal changes in the risk estimator in each scenario. Theoretical results are given to show that the risk estimator has a faster convergence order compared to the conventional uniform inner sampling approach. Numerical results consistent with the theory are presented."

It is shown that the primal-dual simulation method can still be used as a generic way to obtain bounds in the extended framework, and we apply the new results to the pricing of convertible bonds by simulation."
,"Determinants and Outcomes of Internet Banking Adoption","Xue, Mei and Hitt, Lorin M. and Chen, Pei-yu","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","57","2","291-307","2011","FEB","Internet Banking Adoption;Customer Efficiency;Network Effects","","This paper examines the drivers of adoption of Internet banking and the linkages among adoption drivers and outcomes (product acquisition, service activity, profitability, loyalty). We relate Internet banking adoption to customer demand for banking services, the availability of alternative channels, customers' efficiency in service coproduction (customer efficiency), and local Internet banking penetration. We find that customers who have greater transaction demand and higher efficiency, and reside in areas with a greater density of online banking adopters, are faster to adopt online banking after controlling for time, regional, and individual characteristics. Consistent with prior work, we find that customers significantly increase their banking activity, acquire more products, and perform more transactions. These changes in behavior are not associated with short-run increases in customer profitability, but customers who adopt online banking have a lower propensity to leave the bank. Building on these observations we also find that the adoption drivers are linked to the postadoption changes in behavior or profitability. Customers who live in areas with a high branch density or high Internet banking penetration increase their product acquisition and transaction activity more than Internet banking adopters in other regions. Efficient customers and those with high service demand show greater postadoption profitability."
,"Recruiting for Ideas: How Firms Exploit the Prior Inventions of New Hires","Singh, Jasjit and Agrawal, Ajay","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","57","1","129-150","2011","JAN","Inventor Mobility;Access To Ideas;Knowledge Spillovers;Learning By Hiring;Difference In Differences;Coarsened Exact Matching;Collaborative Networks;Patent Citations","","When firms recruit inventors, they acquire not only the use of their skills but also enhanced access to their stock of ideas. But do hiring firms actually increase their use of new recruits' prior inventions? Our estimates suggest they do, quite significantly in fact, by approximately 219% on average. However, this does not necessarily reflect widespread learning by hiring. In fact, we estimate that a recruit's exploitation of her own prior ideas accounts for almost half of the above effect, with much of the diffusion to others being limited to the recruit's immediate collaborative network. Furthermore, although one might expect the recruit's role to diminish rapidly as her tacit knowledge diffuses across her new firm, our estimates indicate that her importance is surprisingly persistent over time. We base these findings on an empirical strategy that exploits the variation over time in hiring firms' citations to the recruits' premove patents. Specifically, we employ a difference-indifferences approach to compare premove versus postmove citation rates for the recruits' prior patents and corresponding matched-pair control patents. Our methodology has three benefits compared to previous studies that also examine the link between labor mobility and knowledge flow: (1) it does not suffer from the upward bias inherent in the conventional cross-sectional comparison, (2) it generates results that are robust to a more stringently matched control sample, and (3) it enables a temporal examination of knowledge flow patterns."
,"Gaining Access by Doing Good: The Effect of Sociopolitical Reputation on Firm Participation in Public Policy Making","Werner, Timothy","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","61","8","1989-2011","2015","AUG","Reputation;Resource Dependency;Nonmarket Strategy;Corporate Social Responsibility","","This paper examines the role of firms' sociopolitical reputations, as proxied by their perceived engagement in socially responsible practices, in public policy makers' decisions to grant access in the policy-making process. I argue that policy makers' dependencies, motivations, and decision-making processes lead them to evaluate firms by using sociopolitical reputation as a differentiating heuristic. I hypothesize that firms that construct stronger sociopolitical reputations will be granted greater access and that firms' existing political activity and policy makers' partisanship will moderate this relationship. I test these hypotheses using an 11-year panel on congressional testimony, reputation, and political and financial characteristics for the S&P 500 and find support for all three. These findings support the existence of a sociopolitical dimension to firms' reputations that affects how public policy makers evaluate firms, demonstrating that corporate social responsibility pays political benefits."

We find that firms with low corporate transparency, measured by a battery of proxies including state ownership, the prevalence of related party transactions, accrual-based earnings management, audit opinions, and the quality of audit firms, are more affected by investor sentiment than are firms with high corporate transparency. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of corporate transparency in mitigating the effects of investor sentiment on stock prices."
,"Interpersonal Bundling","Chen, Yongmin and Zhang, Tianle","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","61","6","1456-1471","2015","JUN","Interpersonal Bundling;Bundling;Group Purchase;Group Discount;Demand Uncertainty","","This paper studies a model of interpersonal bundling, in which a monopolist offers a good for sale under a regular price and a group purchase discount if the number of consumers in a group-the bundle size-belongs to some menu of intervals. We find that this is often a profitable selling strategy in response to demand uncertainty, and it can achieve the highest profit among all possible selling mechanisms. We explain how the profitability of interpersonal bundling with a minimum or maximum group size may depend on the nature of uncertainty and on parameters of the market environment, and we discuss strategic issues related to the optimal design and implementation of these bundling schemes. Our analysis sheds light on popular marketing practices such as group purchase discounts, and it offers insights on potential new marketing innovation."
,"Real Options and American Derivatives: The Double Continuation Region","Battauz, Anna and De Donno, Marzia and Sbuelz, Alessandro","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","61","5","1094-1107","2015","MAY","American Options;Valuation;Optimal Exercise;Real Options;Gold Loan;Collateralized Borrowing;Asymptotic Approximation Of The Free Boundary;Put-Call Symmetry","","We study the nonstandard optimal exercise policy associated with relevant capital investment options and with the prepayment option of widespread collateralized-borrowing contracts like the gold loan. Option exercise is optimally postponed not only when moneyness is insufficient, but also when it is excessive. We extend the classical optimal exercise properties for American options. Early exercise of an American call with a negative underlying payout rate can occur if the option is moderately in the money. We fully characterize the existence, the monotonicity, the continuity, the limits, and the asymptotic behavior at maturity of the double free boundary that separates the exercise region from the double continuation region. We find that the finite-maturity nonstandard policy conspicuously differs from the infinite-maturity one."

Advertisers do not truthfully bid their valuations, and the valuations are uncertain. Furthermore, advertisers are budget constrained. In this paper we analyze a stylized model of the first-page bid estimate (FPBE) mechanism first developed by Google and demonstrate its advantages in dealing with these challenges. We show why and when the FPBE mechanism yields higher profits for the search engine compared with the traditional GSP auction and the GSP auction with advertiser-specific minimum bid. In the event that a high-valuation advertiser is budget constrained, the search engine can use the FPBE mechanism to alter the listing order with the intent of keeping the high-valuation advertiser in the auction for a longer time. The resulting increase in the search engine's profits is not necessarily at the expense of the advertisers because the combined profits of the advertisers and the search engine increase."
,"The Effect of Content on Global Internet Adoption and the Global Digital Divide","Viard, V. Brian and Economides, Nicholas","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","61","3","665-686","2015","MAR","Internet;Technology Adoption;Economic Development;Two-Sided Markets;Network Effects;Technology Diffusion;Digital Divide;Language","","A country's human capital and economic productivity increasingly depend on the Internet as a result of its expanding role in providing information and communications. This has prompted a search for ways to increase Internet adoption and narrow its disparity across countries-the global digital divide. Previous work has focused on demographic, economic, and infrastructure determinants of Internet access that are difficult to change in the short run. Internet content increases adoption and can be changed more quickly; however, the magnitude of its impact, and therefore its effectiveness as a policy and strategy tool, has until now been unknown. Quantifying the role of content is challenging because of feedback (network effects) between content and adoption: more content stimulates adoption, which in turn increases the incentive to create content. We develop a methodology to overcome this endogeneity problem. We find a statistically and economically significant effect, implying that policies promoting content creation can substantially increase adoption. Because it is ubiquitous, Internet content is also useful to effect social change across countries. Content has a greater effect on adoption in countries with more disparate languages, making it a useful tool to overcome linguistic isolation. Our results offer guidance for policymakers on country characteristics that influence adoption's responsiveness to content and for Internet firms on where to expand internationally and how to quantify content investments."

While the prevailing theory of disruptive innovation suggests that this will lead to (exclusively) competitive commercialization and the eventual replacement of incumbents, we consider a dynamic strategy involving product market entry before switching to a cooperative commercialization strategy. Empirical evidence from the automated speech recognition industry from 1952 to 2010 confirms our main hypothesis."
,"Do Parents Matter? Effects of Lender Affiliation Through the Mortgage Boom and Bust","Gartenberg, Claudine","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","60","11","2776-2793","2014","NOV","Corporate Finance;Financial Institutions;Banks;Organization Studies;Strategy;Real Estate","","It is widely acknowledged that the 2007 mortgage crisis was preceded by a broad deterioration in underwriting diligence. This paper shows that this deterioration varied by the industry affiliation of mortgage lenders. Loans issued by homebuilders and stand-alone lenders were significantly less likely to default than loans issued by depository banks and affiliates of major financial institutions. I argue that homebuilders and stand-alone lenders had the least financial capacity to hold mortgages, and their resulting need to sell loans quickly on the secondary market forced them to issue safer loans. Tests of other explanations, including differences in information and incentives to avoid foreclosure externalities, receive little support. This study highlights a novel means by which firm boundaries influence firm adaptation to changing market conditions by defining the boundaries of the internal capital markets and hence the relative constraints of constituent units."

These effects are weaker for older CEOs. Our findings continue to hold when we use variation in divorce laws across states to instrument for CEO marital status, which supports the hypothesis that marriage itself drives choices rather than it just reflecting innate heterogeneity in preferences. We explore various potential explanations for why single CEOs may be less risk averse. Data, as supplemental material, are available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1926."
,"Commissions and Sales Targets Under Competition","Gallego, Guillermo and Talebian, Masoud","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","60","9","2180-2197","2014","SEP","Provider-Broker Competition;Contract Theory;Quantity Discount;Game Theory","","We consider a game between two capacity providers that compete for customers through a broker who earns commissions on sales and sells to both loyal and nonloyal customers. The providers compete by selecting commission margins and sales targets above which the margins on total sales increase. We study the contract form in equilibrium and the effect that sales targets have on the profit split between the providers and the broker. We show that in equilibrium, contracts require positive sales targets that can be best described as a mechanism for the larger provider to profit at the expense of the smaller provider. The effect of sales targets is different when commission margins are exogenous and the providers compete by setting targets. In this case, it is the low-margin provider who benefits from sales targets at the expense of the broker, who in this context resists the imposition of targets."

We conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship of financial literacy and of financial education to financial behaviors in 168 papers covering 201 prior studies. We find that interventions to improve financial literacy explain only 0.1% of the variance in financial behaviors studied, with weaker effects in low-income samples. Like other education, financial education decays over time; even large interventions with many hours of instruction have negligible effects on behavior 20 months or more from the time of intervention. Correlational studies that measure financial literacy find stronger associations with financial behaviors. We conduct three empirical studies, and we find that the partial effects of financial literacy diminish dramatically when one controls for psychological traits that have been omitted in prior research or when one uses an instrument for financial literacy to control for omitted variables. Financial education as studied to date has serious limitations that have been masked by the apparently larger effects in correlational studies. We envisage a reduced role for financial education that is not elaborated or acted upon soon afterward. We suggest a real but narrower role for just-in-time financial education tied to specific behaviors it intends to help. We conclude with a discussion of the characteristics of behaviors that might affect the policy maker's mix of financial education, choice architecture, and regulation as tools to help consumer financial behavior."
,"Money Talks: Rebate Mechanisms in Reputation System Design","Li, Lingfang (Ivy) and Xiao, Erte","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","60","8","2054-2072","2014","AUG","Reputation;Trust;Feedback Mechanism;Asymmetric Information;Public Good;Experimental Economics","","Reputation systems that rely on voluntary feedback from traders are important in creating and sustaining trust in markets. Feedback nevertheless is a public good, and providing it is often costly. We combine theory with a laboratory experiment to study the effect of a seller precommitment mechanism: Sellers have an option to commit by providing a rebate to reduce the buyer's feedback reporting cost before making purchasing decisions. Our theory predicts that this mechanism induces noncooperative sellers to cooperate in the listed-price market. Using a buyer-seller trust game with a unilateral feedback scheme, we find that the seller's rebate decision has a significant impact on the buyer's purchasing decision via signaling the seller's cooperative type. More importantly, market efficiency under the precommitment mechanism increases with the probability that sellers will provide a rebate. Compared with the no rebate mechanism market, more efficient trades can be achieved when the sellers offer a rebate to the buyers in the market with the rebate mechanism, even when the rebate does not cover the full cost of feedback reporting."

In this paper, we provide experimental evidence that some individuals are averse to both positive and negative reputation and will therefore respond to visibility by signaling that they are an '' average altruism type '' relative to their audience. We formalize our hypotheses about '' wallflower '' behavior in a theoretical model. Our experimental results show that instead of uniformly increasing contributions, visibility draws contributions toward the middle of others' contributions. As a result, visibility is associated with higher levels of giving only in scenarios where others are giving a large amount. We also observe heterogeneity in reputation concerns: wallflower behavior is particularly strong for women and can be observed in several different settings."

The implementation of this project is associated with a reduction in online sales and an increase in store sales and traffic. These results can be explained by two simultaneous phenomena: (1) additional store sales from customers who use the BOPS functionality and buy additional products in the stores (cross-selling effect) and (2) the shift of some customers from the online to the brick-and-mortar channel and the conversion of noncustomers into store customers (channel-shift effect). We explain these channel-shift patterns as an increase in research online, purchase offline behavior enabled by BOPS implementation, and we validate this explanation with evidence from the change of cart abandonment and conversion rates of the brick-and-mortar and online channels. We interpret these results in light of recent operations management literature that analyzes the impact of sharing inventory availability information. Our analysis illustrates the limitations of drawing conclusions about complex interventions using single-channel data."

In the study, posting employee performance moderated the relationship between groupwork and employee motivation. When individual performance was publicly posted in the workplace, employees working in a group performed better than when working alone (i.e., social laboring); however, when individual performance was not posted, employees working in a group performed worse than when working alone (i.e., social loafing). The findings shed light on how social comparisons can have positive implications for employee performance in groups."

Although credit spreads and their volatilities increase with the degree of heterogeneity, the decreasing risk premium on moderately levered equity can produce a violation of basic capital structure no-arbitrage relations. Using bottom-up proxies of aggregate belief dispersion, we give empirical support to the model predictions and show that risk premia on corporate bond and stock returns are systematically explained by their exposures to aggregate disagreement shocks."

We show that consulting the agent was beneficial to principals as long as they followed the agent's choice. Ignoring the agent's choice was detrimental to the principal because it engendered negative emotions and low levels of transfers. Nevertheless, the majority of principals were reluctant to change their mind and adopt the agent's proposal. Our results suggest that the ability to change one's own mind is an important dimension of managerial success."

The industry peers cut their capital spending, free cash flows, and cash holdings, and increase their leverage and payouts to shareholders. They also adopt more takeover defenses. The stock price reaction upon announcement of the takeover is positive and larger for peer firms with higher capital spending and higher free cash flows. Before the takeover attempt, the peer firms borrow less and invest more than predicted. Both stock returns and performance improve after the takeover attempt. These results are consistent with the argument that the control threat has important spillover effects for the other firms in the industry."

This influence of analyst recommendation changes on fund herding is stronger for downgrades, and among managers with greater career concerns. These findings indicate that career-concerned managers are incentivized to follow analyst information, and that managers have a greater tendency to herd on negative stock information, given the greater reputational and litigation risk of holding losing stocks. Furthermore, starting in the mid-1990s (when aggregate mutual fund equity ownership is significantly higher), stocks traded by career-concerned herds of fund managers in response to analyst recommendation changes experience a significant same-quarter price impact, followed by a sharp subsequent price reversal. Our evidence suggests that analyst recommendation revisions induce herding by career-concerned fund managers, and that this type of trading has become price destabilizing with the increasing level of mutual fund ownership of stocks."
,"Consumer Favorites and the Design of News","Xiang, Yi and Soberman, David","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","60","1","188-205","2014","JAN","Information Processing;Media Competition;Game Theory","","The objective of this paper is to better understand the factors that competitive news providers consider to design or deliver news programmes. The focus is broadcast news where, in any programming time period, a viewer watches (or consumes) one programme. We assume that each viewer is interested in a limited set of topics and that her utility only comes from the most interesting news she observes. The key questions we address are as follows: (a) Should firms adopt designs that facilitate the delivery of more information in their news programmes? (b) Does the decision of firms to implement such strategies depend on the complexity of the news programme (i.e., the number of news stories covered in the news product)? (c) How do such strategies influence competition? We show that firms may or may not benefit by providing better-designed news. The incentive to do this is strongly affected by the complexity of the news product and the intensity of competition between news providers."

Conventional wisdom attributes this segregation to the homophilous nature of contact networks, and leaves little role for organizational influences. Yet employee referrals are necessarily initiated within a firm by employee referrers subject to organizational policies. We build theory regarding the role of referrers in the segregating effects of network recruitment. Using mathematical and computational models, we investigate how empirically documented referrer behaviors affect job segregation. We show that referrer behaviors can segregate jobs beyond the effects of homophilous network recruitment. Furthermore, and contrary to past understandings, we show that referrer behaviors can also mitigate most, if not all, of the segregating effects of network recruitment. Although largely neglected in previous labor market network scholarship, referrers are the missing links revealing opportunities for organizations to influence the effects of network recruitment."

This surrenders at least part of the effectiveness of regulatory policies to firms' and individuals' decisions to voluntarily submit to regulation. We study individuals' decisions to avoid monitoring or regulation and thus enhance their ability to engage in unethical conduct. We conduct a laboratory experiment in which participants engage in a competitive task and can decide between having the opportunity to misreport their performance or having their performance verified by an external monitor. To study the effect of social factors on the willingness to be subject to monitoring, we vary whether participants make this decision simultaneously with others or sequentially, as well as whether the decision is private or public. Our results show that the opportunity to avoid being submitted to regulation produces more unethical conduct than situations in which regulation is either exogenously imposed or entirely absent."
,"Is Pay for Performance Detrimental to Innovation?","Ederer, Florian and Manso, Gustavo","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","59","7","1496-1513","2013","JUL","Organizational Studies;Motivation Incentives;Personnel;Research And Development;Innovation","","Previous research in economics shows that compensation based on the pay-for-performance principle is effective in inducing higher levels of effort and productivity. On the other hand, research in psychology argues that performance-based financial incentives inhibit creativity and innovation. How should managerial compensation be structured if the goal is to induce managers to pursue more innovative business strategies? In a controlled laboratory setting, we provide evidence that the combination of tolerance for early failure and reward for long-term success is effective in motivating innovation. Subjects under such an incentive scheme explore more and are more likely to discover a novel business strategy than subjects under fixed-wage and standard pay-for-performance incentive schemes. We also find evidence that the threat of termination can undermine incentives for innovation, whereas golden parachutes can alleviate these innovation-reducing effects."

,"An Axiomatic Approach to Systemic Risk","Chen, Chen and Iyengar, Garud and Moallemi, Ciamac C.","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","59","6","1373-1388","2013","JUN","Systemic Risk;Risk Measures;Contagion;Risk Attribution","","Systemic risk refers to the risk of collapse of an entire complex system as a result of the actions taken by the individual component entities or agents that comprise the system. Systemic risk is an issue of great concern in modern financial markets as well as, more broadly, in the management of complex business and engineering systems. We propose an axiomatic framework for the measurement and management of systemic risk based on the simultaneous analysis of outcomes across agents in the system and over scenarios of nature. Our framework defines a broad class of systemic risk measures that accomodate a rich set of regulatory preferences. This general class of systemic risk measures captures many specific measures of systemic risk that have recently been proposed as special cases and highlights their implicit assumptions. Moreover, the systemic risk measures that satisfy our conditions yield decentralized decompositions; i.e., the systemic risk can be decomposed into risk due to individual agents. Furthermore, one can associate a shadow price for systemic risk to each agent that correctly accounts for the externalities of the agent's individual decision making on the entire system."

With a dynamic multiasset model, we predict that the breadth-return relationship can be either positive or negative depending on the relative strength of two offsetting forces-disagreement and sentiment. We find evidence consistent with our predictions. The breadth-return relationship is positive when the sentiment effect is small. However, the relationship becomes negative when (i) the time-series variation of market-wide sentiment is high and (ii) the cross-sectional dispersion of firm-specific exposure to market-wide sentiment variation is large. Our unified framework reconciles a few seemingly inconsistent empirical studies in this literature and explains puzzling cross-sectional return patterns observed during the Internet bubble and the subprime crisis periods."

A simple correlation measure does not suffer from this problem and is proposed here as an alternative to some of the more commonly used measures."

M.","MANAGEMENT SCIENCE","59","4","882-898","2013","APR","Contagion;Interbank Network;Bank Failure;Merger","","This paper is concerned with systemic risk in an interbank market, modelled as a directed graph of interbank obligations. This builds on the modelling paradigm of Eisenberg and Noe [Eisenberg L, Noe TH (2001) Systemic risk in financial systems. Management Sci. 47(2):236-249] by introducing costs of default if loans have to be called in by a failing bank. This immediately introduces novel and realistic effects. We find that, in general, many different clearing vectors can arise, among which there is a greatest clearing vector, arrived at by letting banks fail in succession until only solvent banks remain. Such a collapse should be prevented if at all possible. We then study situations in which consortia of banks may have the means and incentives to rescue failing banks. This again departs from the conclusions of the earlier work of Eisenberg and Noe, where in the absence of default losses there would be no incentive for solvent banks to rescue failing banks. We conclude with some remarks about how a rescue consortium might be constructed."

Compared to other data protection mechanisms, auditing has the features of flexibility and maximum information. Auditing is typically accomplished by examining responses to past queries to determine whether a new query can be answered. It has been recognized that query denials release information and can cause data disclosure. This paper proposes an auditing mechanism that is free of query denial threat and applicable to mixed types of aggregate queries, including sum, max, min, deviation, etc. The core ideas are (i) deriving the complete information leakage from each query denial and (ii) carrying the complete leaked information derived from past answered and denied queries to audit each new query. The information leakage deriving problem can be formulated as a set of parametric optimization programs, and the whole auditing process can be modeled as a series of convex optimization problems."

In this study, we propose mathematical programming formulations and solution methods to efficiently solve the DKM clustering problem. We develop approximation algorithms from a bilinear formulation of the discrete k-median problem using an uncoupled bilinear program algorithm. This approximation algorithm, which we refer to as DKM-L, is composed of two alternating linear programs, where one can be solved in linear time and the other is a minimum cost assignment problem. We then modify this algorithm by replacing the assignment problem with an efficient sequential algorithm for a faster approximation, which we call DKM-S. We also propose a compact exact integer formulation, DKM-I, and a more efficient network design-based exact mixed-integer formulation, DKM-M. All of our methods use arbitrary pairwise distance matrices as input. We apply our methods to simulated single-variate and multivariate random walk time-series data. We report comparative clustering performances using normalized mutual information (NMI) and solution speeds among the DKM methods we propose. We also compare our methods to other clustering algorithms that can operate with distance matrices, such as hierarchical cluster trees (HCT) and partition around medoids (PAM). We present NMI scores and classification accuracies of our DKM algorithms compared to HCT and PAM using five different distance measures on simluated data, as well as public benchmark and real-life neural time-series data sets. We show that DKM-S is much faster than HCT, PAM, and all other DKM methods and produces consistently good clustering results on all data sets."

We formulate a mixed-integer programming model based on a discretization scheme for the problem.

Our approach first develops valid inequalities that enhance the bound and solvability of this formulation. We then provide two alternative formulations, one that yields an improved lower bound on the optimal CETSP tour length, and one that greatly improves the solvability of the original formulation by recasting it as a two-stage problem amenable to decomposition. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

However, supervised methods assume that the training domain and the testing domain share the same distribution; otherwise, accuracy drops dramatically. Although this does not pose problems when training data are readily available, in some circumstances, labeled data is quite expensive to acquire. For instance, if we want to detect sentiment from Tweets or Facebook comments, the only way to acquire is to manually label it, and this is prohibitively burdensome and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates the sentiment information from source-domain labeled data and a set of preselected sentiment words to solve this problem. The experimental results suggest that our method statistically outperforms the state of the art and even, in some cases, surpasses the in-domain gold standard."

The two methods we develop in this paper can not only be used to identify various online shopping patterns across sites and products but can also be applied to settings where patterns exist across different dimensions. Experiments on both synthetic data and real online shopping data demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods."

The variance of the index fund return is required to be below a low-risk threshold with a large probability, thereby limiting the market risk exposure of the investors. The resulting stochastic integer problem is reformulated through the derivation of a deterministic equivalent for the risk constraint and the use of a block decomposition technique. We develop an exact outer approximation method based on the relaxation of some binary restrictions and the reformulation of the cardinality constraint. The method provides a hierarchical organization of the computations with expanding sets of integer-restricted variables and outperforms the Bonmin and the CPLEX solvers. The method can solve large instances (up to 1,000 securities), converges fast, scales well, and is general enough to be applicable to problems with buy-in-threshold constraints."

Several examples in this paper show that the proposed method can be applied to fit HT distributions with a completely monotone probability density function (pdf) very well, like the Pareto distribution and the Weibull distribution with the shape parameter less than one, as well as HT distributions whose pdf is not completely monotone, like the lognormal distribution.

We then develop the C-NORTA algorithm, relying on strategic conditioning of the NORTA vector, followed by efficient approximation and acceptance/rejection steps. We show that, in a certain precise asymptotic sense, the sampling efficiency of C-NORTA is exponentially larger than what is achievable through a naive application of NORTA. Furthermore, for at least a certain class of problems, we show that the acceptance probability within C-NORTA decays only linearly with respect to a defined rarity parameter. The corresponding decay rate achievable through a naive adaptation of NORTA is exponential. We provide directives for efficient implementation."

The relaxation-based dynamic programming algorithm alternates between a forward and a backward search. Each search employs bounds derived in the previous search to prune the search space. Between consecutive searches, the relaxation is tightened using a set of critical resources and a set of critical arcs over which these resources are consumed. As a result, a relatively small state space is maintained, and many paths can be pruned while guaranteeing that an optimal path is ultimately found."
,"An agency perspective on service triads: Linking operational and financial performance","Zhang, Jie J. and Lawrence, Benjamin and Anderson, Chris K.","JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT","35","SI","56-66","2015","MAY","Service Triads;Customer Satisfaction;Service Outsourcing;Agency Theory;Franchising","","We explore one prolific type of service triad, the franchise triad, involving three primary stakeholders: the franchisor, the franchisee and the customer. In this triad, franchisees use their affiliation with the franchisor's brand to attract customers to their local outlets. In exchange for the right of assuming the identity of the brand, the franchisee pays the franchisor royalties and retains residual profits. Applying Agency Theory, this paper examines the inherent conflict of interests between a principal (i.e., franchisor) that controls and manages brand equity as a shared resource and an agent (i.e., franchisee) that retains pricing right and profits from the identity of the brand by interacting directly with customers. We empirically isolate the effect of triad structure on outlet performance by matching two unique datasets. One set of data captures operational performance in the form of aggregated online review scores and the other financial performance including average daily hotel rate and revenue per available room. We find that franchisees charge higher prices than their corporate counterparts even when controlling for operational performance. Even though franchisees charge higher prices they maintain similar financial performance in terms of revenue per available room. These results suggest that the triad structure plays a significant role in franchisees' ability to free-ride on shared brand equity and have important managerial implications for effective outsourcing, contract design and performance evaluation for a wide range of service industries.

For both satisficing measures, we find that the optimal ordering quantity increases with the target level. We determine an optimal order quantity for a target-based newsvendor and characterize its properties with respect to, for example, product's profit margin."

When a large financial institution becomes problematic and is bailed out, that bank is often claimed as too big to fail. On the other hand, to prevent bank's failure, regulatory authorities adopt the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) against a bank that violates certain criteria, often measured by its leverage ratio. In this article, we provide a framework where one can analyze the cost and effect of PCAs. We model a large bank that has deteriorating assets and regulatory actions attempting to prevent the bank's failure. The model uses the excursion theory of Levy processes and finds an optimal leverage ratio that triggers a PCA. A nice feature includes that it incorporates the fact that social cost associated with PCAs are greatly affected by the size of banks subject to PCAs. In other words, one can see the cost of rescuing a bank that is too big to fail."

They play an important role in financial risk management. Among many Monte Carlo methods of estimating the Greeks, the classical pathwise method requires only the pathwise information that is directly observable from simulation and is generally easier to implement than many other methods. However, the classical pathwise method is generally not applicable to the Greeks of options with discontinuous payoffs and the second-order Greeks. In this paper, we generalize the classical pathwise method to allow discontinuity in the payoffs. We show how to apply the new pathwise method to the first- and second-order Greeks and propose kernel estimators that require little analytical efforts and are very easy to implement. The numerical results show that our estimators work well for practical problems."

The robustified risk measures are defined as the worst case portfolio risk over neighborhoods of a reference probability measure, which represent the investors' beliefs about the distribution of future asset losses. It is shown that under mild conditions, the infinite dimensional optimization problem of finding the worst-case risk can be solved analytically and closed-form expressions for the robust risk measures are obtained. Using these results, robust versions of several risk measures including the standard deviation, the Conditional Value-at-Risk, and the general class of distortion functionals are derived. The resulting robust risk measures are convex and can be easily incorporated into portfolio optimization problems, and a numerical study shows that in most cases they perform significantly better out-of-sample than their nonrobust variants in terms of risk, expected losses, and turnover."

We show that the strongest CARP lower bounds can be weak when directly applied to the CARPDD, and we introduce a new family of valid inequalities shown to significantly strengthen these bounds. We develop an exact algorithm for the CARPDD based on cut-and-column generation and branch and price, and we report extensive computational results on a large set of benchmark instances. The same exact algorithm is also tested on classical CARP benchmark sets and is shown to improve upon the best known exact algorithms for the CARP."
,"Flexible PMP Approach for Large-Size Cell Formation","Goldengorin, Boris and Krushinsky, Dmitry and Slomp, Jannes","OPERATIONS RESEARCH","60","5","1157-1166","2012","SEP-OCT","","","Lately, the problem of cell formation (CF) has gained a lot of attention in the industrial engineering literature. Since it was formulated (more than 50 years ago), the problem has incorporated additional industrial factors and constraints while its solution methods have been constantly improving in terms of the solution quality and CPU times. However, despite all the efforts made, the available solution methods (including those for a popular model based on the p-median problem, PMP) are prone to two major types of errors. The first error (the modeling one) occurs when the intended objective function of the CF (as a rule, verbally formulated) is substituted by the objective function of the PMP. The second error (the algorithmic one) occurs as a direct result of applying a heuristic for solving the PMP. In this paper we show that for instances that make sense in practice, the modeling error induced by the PMP is negligible. We exclude the algorithmic error completely by solving the adjusted pseudo-Boolean formulation of the PMP exactly, which takes less than one second on a general-purpose PC and software. Our experimental study shows that the PMP-based model produces high-quality cells and in most cases outperforms several contemporary approaches."
,"Estimating Primary Demand for Substitutable Products from Sales Transaction Data","Vulcano, Gustavo and van Ryzin, Garrett and Ratliff, Richard","OPERATIONS RESEARCH","60","2","313-334","2012","MAR-APR","","","We propose a method for estimating substitute and lost demand when only sales and product availability data are observable, not all products are displayed in all periods (e.g., due to stockouts or availability controls), and the seller knows its aggregate market share. The model combines a multinomial logit (MNL) choice model with a nonhomogeneous Poisson model of arrivals over multiple periods. Our key idea is to view the problem in terms of primary (or first-choice) demand; that is, the demand that would have been observed if all products had been available in all periods. We then apply the expectation-maximization (EM) method to this model, and we treat the observed demand as an incomplete observation of primary demand. This leads to an efficient, iterative procedure for estimating the parameters of the model. All limit points of the procedure are provably stationary points of the incomplete data log-likelihood function. Every iteration of the algorithm consists of simple, closed-form calculations. We illustrate the effectiveness of the procedure on simulated data and two industry data sets."

In these instances, the decision-making process should be informed by the relevance of interactions. However, because of system and model complexity, a rigorous study for determining whether and how interactions quantitatively impact operational choices has not been developed yet. In light of the central role played by the multilinearity of the decision support models, we investigate the presence of interactions in multilinear functions first. We identify interactions that can be a priori excluded from the analysis. We introduce sensitivity measures that apportion the model output change to individual factors and interaction contributions in an exact fashion. The sensitivity measures are linked to graphical representation methods as tornado diagrams and Pareto charts, and a systematic way of inferring managerial insights is presented. We then specialize the findings to reliability and probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) problems. We set forth a procedure for determining the magnitude of changes that make interactions relevant in the analysis. Quantitative results are discussed by application to a PSA model developed at NASA to support decision making in space mission planning and design. Numerical findings show that suboptimal decisions concerning the components on which to focus managerial attention can be made, if the decision-making process is not informed by the relevance of interactions."

The price is known in the former case, while the spot price is uncertain ex-ante in the latter case. Consequently, some shippers are reluctant to book directly from the carrier in advance unless the carrier is willing to partially match the realized spot price when it is lower than the regular price. This study is an initial attempt to examine if the carrier should bear some of the price risk by offering a fractional price matching contract that can be described as follows. The shipper pays the regular freight price in advance; however, the shipper will get a refund if the realized spot price is below the regular price, where the refund is a fraction of the difference between the regular price and the realized spot price. By modeling the dynamics between the carrier and the shippers as a sequential game, we show that the carrier can use the fractional price matching contract to generate a higher demand from the shippers compared to no price matching contract by increasing the fraction in equilibrium. However, as the carrier increases the fraction, the carrier should increase the regular price to compensate for bearing additional risk. By selecting the fractional price matching contract optimally, we show that the carrier can afford to offer this price matching mechanism without incurring revenue loss: the optimal fractional price matching contract is revenue neutral."

In one condition, in each round of play network users independently committed themselves at the origin to a three-segment route; in the other condition, they chose route segments sequentially at each network junction upon receiving en route information. At the end of each round, players received ex-post complete information about the distribution of the route choices. Although the complexity of the network defies analysis by common users, traffic patterns in both conditions converged rapidly to the equilibrium solution. We account for the observed results by a Markov adaptive learning model postulating regret minimization and inertia. We find that subjects' learning behavior was similar across conditions, except that they exhibited more inertia in the condition with en route information."
,"Balancing Revenues and Repair Costs under Partial Information about Product Reliability","Ding, Chao and Rusmevichientong, Paat and Topaloglu, Huseyin","PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT","23","11","1899-1918","2014","NOV","Revenue Management;Reliability;Marketing;Optimal Stopping;Bayesian Learning","","We consider the problem faced by a company selling a product with warranty and under partial information about the product reliability. The product can fail from multiple failure types, each of which is associated with an inherently different repair cost. If the product fails within the warranty duration, then the company is required to pay the repair cost. The company does not know the probabilities associated with different failure types, but it learns the failure probabilities as sales occur and failure information is accumulated. If the failure probabilities turn out to be too high and it becomes costly to fulfill the warranty coverage, then the company may decide to stop selling the product, possibly replacing it with a more reliable alternative. The objective is to decide if and when to stop. By formulating the problem as a dynamic program with Bayesian learning, we establish structural properties of the optimal policy. Since computing the optimal policy is intractable due to the high dimensional state space, we propose two approximation methods. The first method is based on decomposing the problem by failure types and it provides upper bounds on the value functions. The second method provides lower bounds on the value functions and it is based on a deterministic approximation. Computational experiments indicate that the policy from the first method provides noticeable benefits, especially when it is difficult to form good estimates of the failure probabilities quickly."

While demand is uncertain, the firm also faces multi-country foreign currency exposures. This study develops a mean-variance model that maximizes the firm's optimal utility and derives optimal utility and optimal decisions in capacity and financial hedging size. The authors show that when demand and exchange rate risks are perfectly correlated, a risk-averse firm, by using financial hedging, will achieve the same optimal utility as a risk-neutral firm. In this study as well, a special case is examined regarding two suppliers in China and Vietnam. The results show that if a single supplier is contracted, financial hedging most benefits the highly risk-averse firm when the demand and exchange rate are highly negatively related. When only one hedge is used, financial hedging dominates operational hedging only when the firm is very risk averse and the correlation between the two exchange rates have become positive. With both theoretical and numerical results, this study concludes that the two hedges are strategic tools and interact each other to maximize the optimal utility."
