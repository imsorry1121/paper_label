Using text mining, we uncover the key phrases associated with consumer research. We use a topic modeling procedure to uncover 16 topics that have been featured in the journal since its inception and to show the trends in topics over time. For example, we highlight the decline in family decision-making research and the flourishing of social identity and influence research since the journal's inception. A citation analysis shows which JCR articles have had the most impact and compares the topics in top-cited articles with all JCR journal articles. We show that methodological and consumer culture articles tend to be heavily cited. We conclude by investigating the scholars who have been the top contributors to the journal across the four decades of its existence. And to better understand which schools have contributed most to the knowledge of consumer research over this history, we provide an analysis of where these top-performing scholars were trained. Our approach shows that the JCR archives can be an excellent source of data for scholars trying to understand the complicated, challenging, and dynamic field of consumer research.",J1: Others but relevant to marketing (Review article),,,,

This elite status is based, in part, on its stated objective as a multidisciplinary journal that allows for a variety of topics, methods, and populations that are central to collectives of scholars from many social sciences and methodological orientations. While a few articles have reviewed the level of diversity within the journal and among its peers, none to date has taken an expansive look at what is studied, how it is examined, and which consumers are used to determine the validity of our theoretical contributions. Thus this article looks across the life span of JCR to address these issues and finds considerable progress along with major areas that should be addressed by the community of researchers that constitutes our field.",J1: others but relevant to marketing (review articles) ,,,,

A Meta-Meta-Analysis of Effect Sizes in Marketing Research,"Eisend, Martin",JOURNAL OF MARKETING,2015,MAY,79,3,23-40,Marketing Knowledge;Knowledge Accumulation;Effect Size;Meta-Analysis,2Nd-Order Metaanalysis;Scientific Progress;Advertising Works;Publication;Orientation;Performance;Bias;Elasticities;Psychology;Diffusion,Business,"This study measures the value and progress of knowledge produced in marketing research by using meta-analytic effect sizes as a measure of scientific knowledge. The author combines the results of 176 meta-analyses that include data from more than 7,500 primary studies published between 1918 and 2012. The 1,841 meta-analytic effect sizes show that a considerable body of marketing knowledge has been developed, as expressed by a meta-meta-analytic correlation of .24. This medium-sized effect is as strong or stronger than effects that have been found in compilations of meta-analyses in other, more basic fields of inquiry (e.g., psychology), which shows that marketing is a successful academic discipline. The effect sizes vary across subject areas, with pricing showing the strongest effects, followed by consumer behavior; methods and new product development show the weakest effects. This finding reveals different degrees of knowledge production and varying benchmarks to assess the contribution of future research outcomes in these subject areas. Marketing knowledge follows a discontinuous model of progress: knowledge has increased over time, but at a decreasing rate; the marketing field, which is currently characterized by fragmentation and specialization, has reached a stage of maturity. The findings provide implications for further research regarding how to measure, evaluate, and progress knowledge in marketing.",J1: others but relevant to marketing (the effects of marketing knowledge),,,,

To take an initial step toward a theory of relationship dynamics, the authors introduce the construct of commitment velocity or the rate and direction of change in commitment-and articulate its important role in understanding relationships. In two studies, the authors demonstrate that commitment velocity has a strong impact on performance, beyond the impact of the level of commitment. In Study 1, modeling six years of longitudinal data in a latent growth curve analysis, the authors empirically demonstrate the significance of commitment velocity as a predictor of performance. In Study 2, the authors use matched multiple-source data to investigate the drivers of commitment velocity. Both customer trust and dynamic capabilities for creating value through exchange relationships (i.e., communication capabilities for exploring and investment capabilities for exploiting opportunities) affect commitment velocity. However, trust and communication capabilities become less impactful as a relationship ages, while investment capabilities grow more important. The authors offer three post hoc tenets that represent initial components of a theory of relationship dynamics that integrates two streams of relationship marketing research into a unified perspective.",D10: Customer relationship management,,,,

Research in marketing has predominantly focused on dyadic relationships without considering the important interdependencies among different alliances. This study takes a portfolio approach to examine the resource diversity of multiple alliance partners and its contribution to firm innovation. The authors argue that resource diversity in an alliance portfolio can only benefit innovation when resources and information are shared across alliances. They examine factors that may facilitate or inhibit information and resource sharing across alliances and thus influence the realization of any benefit of portfolio resource diversity. The model identifies various factors along three dimensions, including the composition of an alliance portfolio, alliance management, and the market environment, that moderate the relationship between alliance portfolio resource diversity and firm innovation. This study not only demonstrates the conditions for a firm to benefit from diverse partners but also highlights the importance of coordination among different alliances, suggesting a portfolio approach for alliance research.",C5: strategic marketing (organizational alliance and innovation),,,,

While, ceteris paribus, rigor is desirable, there is a growing sense that rigor has become a, if not the, goal for research in marketing. Consequently, other desirable characteristics, such as relevance, communicability, and simplicity, have been downplayed, to the detriment of the field of marketing. The authors explore this imbalance, setting forth the consequences of overemphasis on rigor for (1) the manuscript review process, (2) PhD programs, (3) hiring, and (4) the tenure and promotion review process. Two surveys of successful authors provide empirical support for the conjectures put forth.

Drawing on relational governance and institutional theories, this study offers a contingent view of business and political ties in China. The findings from a survey of 241 Chinese firms indicate that business ties have a stronger positive effect on performance than political ties, and both effects depend on institutional and market environments. Business ties are more beneficial when legal enforcement is inefficient and technology is changing rapidly, whereas political ties lead to greater performance when general government support is weak and technological turbulence is low. These findings indicate that firms operating in China should be cautious in their use of business and political ties and adapt their tie utilization to changing institutional and market environments.",I4: social networks,,,,

Seven studies investigate how bragging about prosocial behavior affects perceived generosity. The authors propose that bragging conveys information about an actor's good deeds, leading to an attribution of generosity. However, bragging also signals a selfish motivation (a desire for credit) that undermines the attribution of generosity. Thus, bragging has a positive effect when prosocial behavior is unknown because it informs others that an actor has behaved generously. However, bragging does not help-and often hurts-when prosocial behavior is already known, because it signals a selfish motive. In addition, the authors demonstrate that conspicuous cause marketing products have effects akin to bragging by signaling an impure motive for doing good deeds. Finally, the authors argue that bragging about prosocial behavior is unique because it undermines the precise information that the braggart is trying to convey (generosity). In contrast, bragging about personal achievements does not affect perceptions of the focal trait conveyed in the brag. These findings underscore the strategic considerations inherent in signaling altruism.",I1: Ethics and social responsibility,,,,

By moving beyond a dyadic view of punishment, this article considers the effects of punishment on observers and integrates insights from social learning, fairness heuristic, and social network theories. The resulting framework of the observer effects of punishment in a distribution network, empirically tested with a survey in China, reveals two mechanisms through which punishment leads to reduced observer opportunism: (1) a direct deterrence effect and (2) a trust-building process. Moreover, two information-related constructs moderate the observer effects differently. The disciplined distributor's relational ennbeddedness, which motivates greater information flow to observers, aggravates the problem of information asymmetry against the manufacturer, making punishment less deterrent for observers. In contrast, the manufacturer's monitoring capability, which reduces information asymmetry, strengthens observer effects. The authors discuss both theoretical and managerial implications of using punishment to achieve collaboration from a wide network of channel members.",E2: Channel management,,,,

They first provide empirical evidence that suggests that the well-understood information incentive for physicians to experiment with new drugs is reduced when physicians anticipate future detailing. Therefore, increased detailing activity triggers opposing forces: Adoption is hastened as physicians become informed (assuming prior knowledge is initially low) and slows as they reduce experimentation and instead obtain information from detailing at no cost. The authors then estimate a dynamic Bayesian learning model that embodies these trade-offs using physician-level data on prescription choices and detailing received in the months surrounding the introduction of two erectile dysfunction drugs, Levitra and Cialis. Detailing elasticities are lower when physicians anticipate changes in detailing activity than when such changes are unexpected. Accordingly, the authors conclude that to maximize the effect of detailing, firms should avoid announcing increases in detailing activities.",F2: Bayesian Methods/Bayesian Analysis,,,,

The results of a longitudinal study of 284 buyer-supplier relationships indicate that relational behavior enhances financial performance when what is exchanged does not need to be directly comparable with what was received (i.e., heteromorphic equivalence reciprocity) or can be returned over a longer time horizon (i.e., long-term immediacy reciprocity). Moreover, relational behavior diminishes financial performance when what is exchanged must be directly comparable in form (i.e., homeomorphic equivalence reciprocity) or returned over a short time horizon (i.e., short-term immediacy reciprocity). The authors further conclude that a longitudinal interaction effect model provides a more accurate understanding of the relational behavior-performance relationship when compared with a cross-sectional interaction effect model, because it minimizes the unobserved heterogeneity effect, thus strengthening causal inference.",E2: Channel management,,,,

I treat athletic success as a stock of goodwill that decays over time, similar to that of advertising. A major challenge is that privacy laws prevent us from observing information about the applicant pool. I overcome this challenge by using order statistic distribution to infer applicant quality from information on enrolled students. Using a flexible random-coefficients aggregate discrete choice model that accommodates heterogeneity in preferences for school quality and athletic success, as well as an extensive set of school fixed effects to control for unobserved quality in athletics and academics, I estimate the impact of athletic success on applicant quality and quantity. Overall, athletic success has a significant, long-term goodwill effect on future applications and quality. However, students with lower-than-average SAT scores tend to have a stronger preference for athletic success, whereas students with higher SAT scores have a greater preference for academic quality. Furthermore, the decay rate of athletics' goodwill is significant only for students with lower SAT scores, suggesting that the goodwill created by intercollegiate athletics resides more extensively with lower-scoring students than with their higher-scoring counterparts. But, surprisingly, athletic success impacts applications even among academically stronger students.",B2: Advertising Effectiveness,,,,

This article reviews these papers and projects, examines their influence on the relevant organizations, and provides a perspective on the diffusion and impact of marketing science models within the organizations. We base our analysis on three sources of data-the articles, authors' responses to a survey, and in-depth interviews with the authors. We draw some conclusions about how marketing science models can create more impact without losing academic rigor while maintaining strong relevance to practice. We find that the application and diffusion of marketing science models are not restricted to the well-known choice models, conjoint analysis, mapping, and promotional analysis-there are very effective applications across a wide range of managerial problems using an array of marketing science techniques. There is no one successful approach, and although some factors are correlated with impactful marketing science models, there are a number of pathways by which a project can add value to its client organization. Simpler, easier-to-use models that offer robust and improved results can have a stronger impact than academically sophisticated models can. Organizational buy-in is critical and can be achieved through recognizing high-level champions, holding in-house presentations and dialogues, doing pilot assignments, involving multidepartment personnel, and speaking the same language as the influential executives. And we find that intermediaries often, but not always, play a key role in the transportability and diffusion of models across organizations. Although these applications are impressive and reflect profitable academic practitioner partnerships, changes in the knowledge base and reward systems for academics, intermediaries, and practitioners are required for marketing science approaches to realize their potential impact on a much larger scale than the highly selective sample that we have been able to analyze.",J1: Others but relevant to marketing,,,,

Several findings emerge. First, pricing and game theory are the most ubiquitous words. More generally, the three C's and four P's predominate, suggesting that keywords and common practical frameworks align. Various trends exist. Some words, like pricing, remain popular over time. Others, like game theory and hierarchical Bayes, have become more popular. Finally, some words are superseded by others, like diffusion by social networking. Second, the overall rate of new keyword introductions has increased, but the likelihood they will remain in use has decreased. This suggests a maturation of the discipline or a long-tail effect. Third, a correspondence analysis indicates three distinct eras of marketing modeling, comporting roughly with each of the past three decades. These eras are driven by the emergence of new data and business problems, suggesting a fluid field responsive to practical problems. Fourth, we consider author publication survival rates, which increase up to six papers and then decline, possibly as a result of changes in ability or motivation. Fifth, survival rates vary with the recency and nature of words.

Scoring relies on ordered lists of probabilities that customers act in a way that contributes revenues, e.g., purchase something from the firm. Targeting identifies constrained sets of covariate patterns associated with high probabilities of these acts. Influencing aims at changing the probabilities that individual customers act accordingly through marketing activities. We show that successful targeting and influencing decisions require inference that controls for endogenous selection, whereas scoring can proceed relatively successfully based on simpler models that provide (local) approximations, capitalizing on spurious effects of observed covariates. To facilitate the type of inference required for targeting and influencing, we develop a prior that frees the analyst from having to specify (often arbitrary) exclusion restrictions for model identification a priori or to explicitly compare all possible models. We cover exclusions of observed as well as unobserved covariates that may cause the successive selections to be dependent. We automatically infer the dependence structure among selection stages using Markov chain Monte Carlo-based variable selection, before identifying the scale of latent variables. The adaptive parsimony achieved through our prior is particularly helpful in applications where the number of successive selections exceeds two, a relevant but underresearched situation.",F2: Bayesian Methods/Bayesian Analysis,,,,

However, thousands of similar-looking variable annuity products are being offered by hundreds of financial service companies. In such a scenario, how can Prudential achieve meaningful product differentiation to increase the sales of its variable annuities? The solution led to the development and implementation of the Emotion Quotient (EQ) Tool. The EQ Tool enabled Prudential to redefine its marketing and sales approach along a proactive (as opposed to responsive) market orientation paradigm. This was accomplished by first using the EQ Tool to uncover and quantify the prevalence of certain emotions (such as fear and regret) in the prospective consumer and then pitching relevant variable annuity product(s) that could mitigate the specific behavioral risk corresponding to the prevalent emotion(s). This approach, which was backed by extensive research (as described in this study), enabled Prudential to gain over $450 million lift in variable annuity sales and contributed to consumer welfare by promoting awareness of behavioral risk to investors who are within five years of their retirement.

Extant reconciliations of these patterns in the popular press rely on ad hoc reasoning. Using historical data on currency crisis episodes across the world, we show that the impact of the crisis on a firm's business is best understood by focusing on the impact of the crisis on the behavior of consumers. Our analyses show that consumer behavior in a crisis is characterized by consumption smoothing at various levels-intertemporal, intercategory, and intracategory. These behavioral adjustments result in significant reallocation of consumption expenditures. More importantly, the smoothing decisions because of a crisis are distinct and independent of the impact of changes in income and prices that accompany a crisis. Interestingly, there is marked variation in the patterns of consumption smoothing across different types of economies. Taken together, these results have important and interesting implications for managers, policy makers, and academics.",F3: Econometrics,,,,
ISI:000288939700012,Demystifying Disruption: A New Model for Understanding and Predicting Disruptive Technologies,"Sood, Ashish and Tellis, Gerard J.",MARKETING SCIENCE,2011,MAR-APR,30,2,339-354,Technology Disruption;Firm Disruption;Demand Disruption;Correlated Hazards;Prediction Of Disruption,Radical Product Innovation;Complementary Assets;Punctuated Equilibria;Industry;Firms;Performance;Competition;Incumbency;Advantage;Paradigms,Business,"T he failure of firms in the face of technological change has been a topic of intense research and debate, spawning the theory (among others) of disruptive technologies. However, the theory suffers from circular definitions, inadequate empirical evidence, and lack of a predictive model. We develop a new schema to address these limitations. The schema generates seven hypotheses and a testable model relating to platform technologies. We test this model and hypotheses with data on 36 technologies from seven markets. Contrary to extant theory, technologies that adopt a lower attack (potentially disruptive technologies) (1) are introduced as frequently by incumbents as by entrants, (2) are not cheaper than older technologies, and (3) rarely disrupt firms; and (4) both entrants and lower attacks significantly reduce the hazard of disruption. Moreover, technology disruption is not permanent because of multiple crossings in technology performance and numerous rival technologies coexisting without one disrupting the other. The proposed predictive model of disruption shows good out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We discuss the implications of these findings.",F6: other methods,,,,
